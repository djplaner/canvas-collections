# Canvas Collections 

:confetti_ball: Version 1.1.0 - the first really usable version of Collections - is now available. See the [Collections site](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/) more for details  :confetti_ball:

Canvas Collections helps improve course site designs for the [Canvas LMS](https://canvaslms.instructure.com/lp/lms/) by transforming the [Canvas Modules page](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/resources/blog/how-use-modules-build-courses-canvas). The following summarises the key features and provides links to more information.


| Feature | Why? | How? | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Structure | Move beyond the ["..design nightmare (of)...one big list"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/More-editing-functions/idc-p/475281/highlight/true#M53223) | Organise modules into [different collections](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/101/concepts/#collections). Navigate between different collections only seeing relevant modules. |
| Visuals | Move beyond visuals reminiscent of ["a chain of folders circa Windows 95"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Visual-based-Module-Outline-PLEASE/m-p/395779/highlight/true#M140332) | Select a different [representation](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/101/concepts/#representations) for each collection. Change at any time. Develop new purpose-built representations. |
| Context | Add more context to modules (e.g. ["connective text"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Is-there-a-way-to-add-connective-text-not-quot-text-headers-quot/m-p/510878), ["instructions or a greeting"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Ideas/Modules-Add-Images-to-Modules/idc-p/372263/highlight/true#M9258) etc) | Add [(meta-)data](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/101/concepts/#context-objects-through-metadata) to each module. Add an [include page](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/reference/conceptual-model/collections/existing-collections/#include-page) to each collection. |


## For example

Examine the standard Canvas modules page on the left. This course was designed with three driving questions. Can you tell what those questions are from the modules page?

Try with the image on the right. It shows the same modules page with Collections installed.

See the [Canvas Collections documentation site](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/) for more.
