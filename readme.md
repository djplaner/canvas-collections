# Canvas Collections 

:confetti_ball: Version 1.1.0 - the first really usable version of Collections - is now available. See the [Collections site](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/) more for details  :confetti_ball:

## Why?

Frustrated by the limitations of the [Canvas LMS' modules](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas)? Wanting to achieve more than a long list of modules with no design of context specific information?

For example, look at the standard Canvas modules page on the left. This course was designed with three driving questions. Can you tell what those questions are from the modules page?

Try with the image on the right. It shows the same modules page with Collections installed.

See the [Collection site] for more.

## How?

Canvas Collections adds three three new features to Canvas Modules:

1. **Collections** - group modules together based on your design needs.
2. **Representations** - select different visual designs for each collection.
3. **Objects** - add more information to transform vanilla Canvas modules into context and design specific objects (e.g. theme, chapter, person etc).

## How can you use Canvas Collections?

You will need [to install Collections](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/install/types-pre-requisites/). You can do this as [an individual](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/install/individual/) or as [an institution](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/install/institution/)
