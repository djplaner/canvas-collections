# Collections' Conceptual Model

Collections is made up of four main concepts summarised in the table below. 

!!! info "For reference information on using each concept to configure Collections, use the relevant link in the following table."

!!! info "For video examples of each concept, see the [Concepts page](../../getting-started/101/concepts.md) in the _Getting Started_ section."

| Concept | Description |
| ---- | ----- |
| [collections](collections/overview.md) | Canvas modules are grouped into _collections_ |
| [representations](representations/overview.md) | _collections_ can be visualised in different ways using _representations_ |
| [objects](objects/overview.md) | By adding more context/design specific information to a Canvas module you can transform it (at least visually) into a context-specific _object_ |
| [Claytons](./representations/claytons/overview.md) | A method to add the Collections' representations to a static Canvas page. Allowing people to use the representation without needing Collections. It is the [Claytons version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytons) of Collections. The Collections you have, when you're not having Collections |

!!! tip "The difference between <span style="background-color:black;color:white">C</span>ollections and <span style="background-color:black;color:white;">c</span>ollections"


    The use of upper or lower case _C_ distinguishes between two different concepts:

	1. **C**ollections - refers to _Canvas Collections_, the entire tool.
	2. **c**ollections - you use the tool (Collections) to create _collections_ and allocate different Canvas modules to belong to different _collections_.
