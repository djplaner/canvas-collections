# Collections' Conceptual Model

Collections is made up of four main concepts summarised in the table below. 

!!! info "For reference information on using each concept to configure Collections, use the relevant link in the following table."

!!! info "For video examples of each concept, see the [Concepts page](../../getting-started/101/concepts.md) in the _Getting Started_ section."

| Concept | Description |
| ---- | ----- |
| [collections](collections/overview.md) | Canvas modules are grouped into _collections_ |
| [representations](representations/overview.md) | _collections_ can be visualised in different ways using _representations_ |
| [objects](objects/overview.md) | By adding more context/design specific information to a Canvas module you can transform it (at least visually) into a context-specific _object_ |
| [Claytons](../conceptual-model/representations/claytons/overview.md) | A method to add the Collections' representations to a static Canvas page. Allowing people to use the representation without needing Collections. It is the [Claytons version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytons) of Collections. The Collections you have, when you're not having Collections |


!!! tip "The difference between _**C**ollections_ and _**c**ollections_"

	The use of upper or lower case C is deliberate (and perhaps a touch patchy) in this site, the difference is

	- **C**ollections - refers to _Canvas Collections_, the entire tool.
	- **c**ollections - refers to the _collections_ of individual Canvas modules you create and manage using Collections (the tool).
