### GriffithCards

The following animated image shows the [same vanilla Canvas course](overview.md#vanilla-canvas) with the same collections as the previous example. However, this time the _GriffithCards_ representation is being used. This representation generates a card for each [object (aka Module)](../objects/overview.md) that belongs to the collection. It mirrors the widely used [card UI design pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/). 

Everything else (e.g. the navigation bar, include pages, and the modules belonging to the collection) is the same

The card component can help transform the vanilla Canvas module into a [design and context specific object](../objects/overview.md) by displaying additional attributes, including (but not limited to): a textual description; a label and sequence number; associated dates; and, a card image.
