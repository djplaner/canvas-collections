# Collections Only

The following animated image shows the above course configured with Canvas Collections so that its 13 modules are organised into three collections: _Why?_, _What?_, and _How?_. 

In this example, each collection is using the _Collections Only_ representation. This is the bare minimum Collections' representation, which modifies the Canvas modules page to include:

1. The collection's navigation bar (hence the name, _Collections Only_).

    This is how you navigate between collections.

2. Any [Include Pages](../collections/overview.md#include-page) configured for the collection.

    The _Why?_ collection includes some text (_A little bit of an include page -- one one 111_) after the collection's navigation bar. This is the content of a Canvas page that has been configured as an _Include Page_ for the collection.

3. The modules belonging to the current collection.

	This is the standard Canvas Modules view, however, when viewing a collection you will only see the modules that belong to the current collection.

The above three elements are the bare minimum changes that Collections (when turned on) makes to the Canvas Collections page. The remaining
