# Objects

## Transforming vanilla Canvas modules into design specific objects

Canvas modules only provide the information and functionality provided by vanilla Canvas. There is little or no explicit method for adding more context or design specific information. Hence modules remain modules.

Canvas Collections provides the _module configuration area_ as a space where you can provide more design and context specific information about a module. Transforming it from a vanilla Canvas module into a design specific object. Consequently, making it easier for course participants to understand the conceptual model underpinning your course design. Better understand how, when, and what they should be doing with these objects (Canvas modules).
## The Module Configuration area

With Collections installed and _Edit on_ each Canvas module will have its own Collections' _module configuration area_. This is how you add and modify the additional design specific data. The animated image below shows what this looks like.

The _Module Configuration_ area is divided into a number of tabs. The following table summarises the purpose of each tab. The links below are to pages that provide more detailed information about each tab and how it works.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [General](./general.md) | <p>Configure _general_ metadata, including: description, collection allocation, label, FYI, engage.</p> |
| [Dates](./dates.md) | <p>Specify the date or date period that applies to a module.</p> |
| [Banner](./banner.md) | <p>Configure the banner (image, colour, or iframe) for a module.</p> |
| [Metadata](./metadata.md) | <p>Provide and modify additional _metadata_ beyond Collections specific metadata. Used by some representations.</p> |
