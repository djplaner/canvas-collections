# Objects (aka Activities)

Vanilla Canvas modules can only provide the information and functionality provided by vanilla Canvas. The only space where design (e.g. that the module is a lecture or assessment etc) or context specific (e.g. the date it is due) information can be added to a vanilla Canvas module is the module name. But this is limited and manual.

Collections supports the association of design and context specific information (metadata) with Canvas modules. This information can then be used by Collections representations and other functionality. The key intent of this feature is to help you transform vanilla Canvas modules into design and context specific objects. To make it easier for people to understand the conceptual model underpinning your course design. To better understand how, when, and what they should be doing with these objects (Canvas modules).

## The Module Configuration area

The additional metadata is added and modified via each module's Collections _Module Configuration_ area. The image below shows how to acccess the _Module Configuration_ area.

The _Module Configuration_ area is divided into a number of tabs. The following table summarises the purpose of each tab and provides a link to more information about that tab.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [General](./general.md) | <p>Configure _general_ metadata, including: description, collection allocation, label, FYI, engage.</p> |
| [Dates](./dates.md) | <p>Specify the date or date period that applies to a module.</p> |
| [Banner](./banner.md) | <p>Configure the banner (image, colour, or iframe) for a module.</p> |
| [Metadata](./metadata.md) | <p>Provide and modify additional _metadata_ beyond Collections specific metadata. Used by some representations.</p> |
