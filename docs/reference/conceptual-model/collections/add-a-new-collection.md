## Features and Properties

_Add a new collection_ provides three features/properties:

1. Specify the _name_ of the new collection.
2. Select the _representation_ for the new collection.
3. Add the new collection.

## Name

A collection's _name_ is used as part of the Canvas Collections navigation bar. i.e. it is visible to site visitors and used to identify the collection. In theory a name can be as long as you like, however, it will need to fit appropriately into the navigation bar.

You enter the _name_ using the provided text box.  The name can be changed after the collection is created - see [the Existing collections page](existing-collections.md).

!!! warning "Each collection's name must be unique."

## Representation

A collection's _representation_ specifies how its modules will be presented visually to the site visitor. Once a collection is created, the representation can be changed at any time and as many times as necessary.

To choose the _representation_ for the new collection, select the desired representation from the provided menu.
