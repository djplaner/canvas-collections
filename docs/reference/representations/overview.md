# Representations

Each collection can choose from a list of representations. Currently available representations are summarised in the table and the demonstrations below.

!!! note "Separating representation from information"

    A collection's representation can be changed at any time (and then changed back). e.g. the animated examples below used the same course site. The only difference is that the representation for each collection was changed. Each representation offers a different way of showing a collection and its objects.

	New representations can be added.


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CollectionsOnly](#collections-only) | No additional representation is added for the collection. The standard Canvas Modules view is used - but only the modules belonging to the current collection are shown. |
| [GriffithCards](#griffithcards) | Implements a card interface. Each of the current collection's modules are represented by a visual card. Provides a number of advanced features. |
| [AssessmentTable](#assessmenttable) | Generates a responsive table where each of the current collection's modules are represented by a row. Design to provide information for assessment items. |

## Collections Only

The following animated image shows a course with three modules: Why?, What?, and How?. Each collection is using the _Collections Only_ representation. i.e. Collections is not adding any additional visualisation. All that is shown is

1. The collection's navigation bar (hence the name, _Collections Only_).

    This is how you navigate between collections.

2. The modules belonging to the current collection.

	This is the standard Canvas Modules view, however, when viewing a collection you will only see the modules that belong to the current collection.
