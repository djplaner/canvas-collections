# "Claytons" Collections

## What?

"Claytons" Collections is the Collections you have when you're not having Collections ([a play on "Claytons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytons)). 

Live (or proper) Canvas Collections is  implemented using Javascript - either implemented [individually](../../../getting-started/install/individual.md) or [institutionally](../../../getting-started/install/institutional.md) - to modify the Canvas modules view. It is not uncommon for either "live" approach not to be available or appropriate. 

"Claytons" Collections is the fall-back. It provides a mechanism by which Collection's representations of the Canvas modules view can be written to Canvas pages. Meaning there's no need for Javascript.
