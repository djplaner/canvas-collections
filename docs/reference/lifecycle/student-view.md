# Student View

Students experience with both _live_ and _Claytons_ Collections is almost the same as teachers/designers experience of [navigating Collections](../../how-tos/navigating/overview.md). Any differences are summarised in the following table.

| Collections Type | Possible differences: student & teacher/designer |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| _Live_ Collections | Teachers/designers will see slightly more information due to increased permissions (e.g. unpublished modules, additional/different Collections messaging). |
| _Claytons_ Collections | The only difference will be from normal Canvas practices. For example, if the Canvas page containing the Claytons representation is unpublished, students will not be able to view it.|

For more detail and animated examples, see the:

- [Navigating _Live_ Collections page](../../how-tos/navigating/navigating-live-collections.md); and,
- [Navigating _Claytons_ Collections page](../../how-tos/navigating/navigating-claytons-collections.md).
