# Course Copy - Canvas Collections

After copying a course with Canvas Collections, the first time you visit the course modules page you will see the following, asking you _How to proceed with the import of Canvas Collections configuration?_ The following explains the dialog, its three tabs, and what to do.

## Summary

The dialog's initial tab provides a 
- summary of the copy process (source & destination courses); and,
- your three options: Proceed; Cancel; or Refresh.

### Proceed

With this choice, Collections will proceed with the import of the configuration. Where possible, 
- Any Canvas module ids in the Collections configuration will be modified from the source ids to the destination course ids.
- Any card images will be updated to use matching images in the destination course.

!!! tip "A _clean_ copy is a _good_ copy"

	If you've not made any changes to the modules/images and the destination course had no modules before th copy, then this will be straight forward.

### Cancel

This choice cancels the import. Collections will not be active, and cannot be active until you complete the import either by proceeding or refreshing.

Use _Cancel_ when you need to analyse or make changes to the destination course before proceeding with the import.

### Refresh

Refresh creates a brand new Collections configuration for the course. All the previous,  


!!! tip "Use Canvas' page history to restore a previous configuration"

	Collections configuration is stored on a [Canvas page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Pages/ta-p/5). Canvas maintains a [history of each page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-the-history-of-a-page-in-a-course/ta-p/900) in a course. 

	If you want to restore a previous Collections' configuration, use the page history for the _Canvas Collections Configuration_ page.


## Modules

Summarises Collections analysis of the modules in the destination course and their relationship to Collections configuration. It will group modules into one of three categories:

| Category | Description | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Imported modules matched** | <p>Modules in Collections configuration (imported from the other course) that have been matched (by module name) with modules in the destination course. </p> | <p>Nothing required. Proceed with the import.</p> |
| **Imported modules not matched** | <p>Modules from the Collections configuration that do not have a match in the destination course. Typically, meaning you chose not to copy the missing modules, or have deleted them before importing Collections. </p> | <p>Two options, depending on your intent, either: </p> <ol> <li> Proceed - </li> <li> Cancel - </li> </ol> |
| ** Current modules not matched** | <p>Modules in the destination course that do not have a match in the Collections configuration. These may be modules that were already in the destination course, or a sign that copied modules were renamed before running Collections import. </p> | <p>Two options, depending on your intent, either: </p> <ol> <li> Proceed - </li> <li> Cancel - </li> </ol> |
