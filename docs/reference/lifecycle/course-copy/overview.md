# Course Copy - Canvas Collections

Canvas provides a [course copy process](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-copy-content-from-another-Canvas-course-using-the/ta-p/1012). A method for reusing content from one course to another. Canva Collections supports course copying with its configuration information. The following explains.

!!! tip "A _clean_ copy will be a _good_ copy"

	A _clean_ copy is where you copy all of a course's Collections/Modules related information into an empty course (no existing modules) and make no changes before doing the Collections import process.

	**A _clean_ copy will be a _good_ copy.**


## How it works

Canvas Collections configuration information is stored in a Canvas page titled _Canvas Collections Configuration_. Canvas Collections considers copying this page from one course to another a course copy. However, before the copy is finalised, the configuration needs to be modified to work with the new course (e.g. new module ids, using images from the new course etc). Depending on the copy process, this may be straight forward, or not.

The first you visit the modules page of the destination course after copying the Collections configuration page, Collections will analyse the copy and present you with the following dialog. It provides some basic information about the copy process and asks you _How to proceed with the import of Canvas Collections configuration?_ It will continue asking this question until you choose.

The dialog consists of three tabs:

1. Summary - some background detail and a summary of your three options.
2. Modules - a list of all the modules in the original Collections configuration and whether or not Collections has detected similarly named modules in the destination course.
4. Images - a list of all Collections' card images that were based in the original course's files area, and whether Collections found the same images in the destination course.
