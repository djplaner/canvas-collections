# Editing Collections

Teachers/designers for a course are able to edit Collections to update the configuration to suit their design intent.


=== "Pre-requisites"

	Before you can edit Collections, you must

	1. Be able to see [the _Student View_ button](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-course-as-a-test-student-using-Student-View/ta-p/1122) on the course modules page.
	2. Successfully turn _edit on_. (see the _edit life cycle_)

	!!! note "Only one person, in one browser window can edit Collections for a course"

		To ensure that the Collections configuration information is not corrupted, only one person can edit the Collections configuration information for a course at a time.

		Also, this person can only edit the Collections configuration information in one browser window at a time.

=== "Edit life cycle"

	To modify Collections you will complete the [edit life cycle](lifecycle.md): turn edit one; make changes; turn edit off. 

	!!! note "Only one person, in one browser window can edit Collections for a course"

		To ensure that the Collections configuration information is not corrupted, only one person can edit the Collections configuration information for a course at a time.

		Also, this person can only edit the Collections configuration information in one browser window at a time.

=== "Configure Collections"

	Your first step will normally be to [Configure Collections](collections.md), including tasks such as:

	- Creating individual Collections;
	- Managing the order of Collections;
	- Changing the configuration of each Collection;
	- Using "Collections level" functionality such as generating a Claytons Collection.

=== "Configure Modules"

	Once you've configured Collections, you can then begin to [Configure Modules](modules.md) to work with Collections, including tasks such as:

	- Specifying which collection a module belongs to; and,
	- Modifying the Collections' metadata associated with the module.

=== "Create Claytons Collections"

	If required and once you've configured Collections and Modules, you can then create any required [Claytons Collections](claytons.md).
