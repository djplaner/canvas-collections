# Navigating Canvas Collections (_live_)

A teacher/designer can use the live Canvas Collections navigation interface to perform specific navigation tasks (explained below)

===	"Switch between collections"

	Clicking on the collection name in the _Navigation bar_ will switch to a collection.

	</figure>

=== "Return to the last collection you were looking at"

	The first time you visit a Collections' page you will see the default collection.  But, Collections will remember the last collection you viewed. When you return to the Collections' page that collection will be active.
	
	!!! warning "Only for the same browser, on the same computer"

		Collections' "memory" only works for the specific version of the browser you are using on the current computer.

	<sl-animated-image alt="Returning to the last collection you were looking at" src="../images/animatedReturn.gif" />
	</figure>

=== "Navigate directly to a collection"

	Each collection has its unique URL. You can use that URL to navigate directly to a collection. 
	
	For example, including that link in a Canvas page to take students to a specific collection.

	<figure markdown>
	<figcaption>Direct navigation to a collection</figcaption>
	<sl-animated-image alt="Direct navigation to a collection" src="../images/animatedDirectNavigation.gif" />
	</figure>


=== "Navigate to a module"

	When a collection is using a representation, most representations will provide a method to link directly to a specific module within the display of current collection's Canvas modules. 

	<figure markdown>
	<figcaption>Direct navigation to a module</figcaption>
	<sl-animated-image alt="Direct navigation to a module" src="../images/animatedDirectModuleNavigation.gif" />
	</figure>


=== "Scroll to a module"

	Since all the modules allocated to the current collection are visible underneath the current collection's representation, you can simply scroll down the page to find any module allocated to the collection.

	<figure markdown>
	<figcaption>Scrolling to a module</figcaption>
	<sl-animated-image alt="Scrolling to a module" src="../images/animatedScrolling.gif" />
	</figure>
