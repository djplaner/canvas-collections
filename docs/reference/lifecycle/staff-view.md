# Staff view of Canvas Collections

The teacher/designer experience of Collections depends on the type of Collections (i.e. _Live_ or _Claytons_) and the mode when using _live_ Collections (i.e. _navigate_ or _edit_).

=== "_Claytons_ Collections" 

	Claytons Collections is static HTML representation of Collections saved to a Canvas page. The teacher/designer experience is the same as any other page. They can view, modify, and delete it.
	
	See [the _Navigating Claytons Collections_ page](../../../how-tos/navigating/navigating-claytons-collections.md) for more information


=== "_Live_ Collections - _navigate_ mode"

	Largely the same as the student experience navigating _live_ Collections, but with slightly more permissions.
	
	See 

	- [the _Navigating_ reference](navigating.md) for details; and, 
	- [the _Navigating Live Collections_ how-to](../../../how-tos/navigating/navigating-live-collections.md) for examples.

=== "_Live_ Collections - _edit_ mode"

	Teachers/designers are able to turn _Edit on_ to enter _edit_ mode and thus configure Collections.
	
	See
	
	- [the _Editing_ reference](editing.md) for details; and, 
	- [the _Editing Live Collections_ how-to](../../../how-tos/editing/editing-live-collections.md) for examples.
