# Visibility

Claytons Collections generates static Canvas pages containing representations of collections. Once the pages are created, viewing them does not use Canvas Collections. The visibility of Claytons Collections is dependent on the visibility of those Canvas pages. As per standard Canvas practice, [unpublished pages are invisible to students](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-or-unpublish-a-page-as-an-instructor/ta-p/592)
