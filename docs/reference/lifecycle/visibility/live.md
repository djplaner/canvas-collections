# Visibility - Live Collections

Who is able to see and use Collections in its live form depends on two elements:
1. Whether Collections has been turned on for the course.
1. Whether the Collections Configuration page is published.
2. Collections' visibility setting; and,

!!! warning 

     Students can't use Collections if the configuration page is not published.
     
=== "Off or on"

     Collections is optional. It is not available by default. It must be turned on (and configured) by a teacher/designer before it can be used.

     If Collections is turned off, then students will see the vanilla Canvas modules view. Teachers/designers will see a limited Collections configuration element with an option to turn Collections on.

=== "Published or unpublished"

     As per standard Canvas practice, [unpublished pages are invisible to students](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-or-unpublish-a-page-as-an-instructor/ta-p/592). If the _Canvas Collections Configuration_ page is unpublished, then students are unable to interact with Canvas Collections. 
     
     This also applies to teacher/designer roles when [using _Student View_](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-view-a-course-as-a-test-student-using-Student-View/ta-p/1122).

     When you first turn on Collections, the configuration file is unpublished. You will need to publish it before students can use Collections. The Collections element will remind you if the configuration page is unpublished. You can click on the _unpublished_ button to open the configuration page in a new browser tab and publish it.
