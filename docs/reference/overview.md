# Reference - Canvas Collections

References provide short descriptions of specific aspects of Collections.


=== "Lifecycle"

    Information about the lifecycle of using Collections as experienced by the user.

    - [Visibility](./lifecycle/visibility.md) - who can see Collections and when.
    - [Student View](./lifecycle/student-view.md) - how students experience Collections.
    - Staff - have a slightly broader lifecyle, including
      - [Staff view](./lifecycle/staff-view.md) - how staff view Collections.
      - [Edit](./lifecycle/edit.md) - how staff (and only staff) edit Collections.

=== "Conceptual Model"

    Collections is designed using a conceptual model. Understanding that conceptual model may help you understand how to use Collections more effectively. The model is based on the following concepts:

    - [collections](conceptual-model/collections/overview.md) - you group Canvas modules into _collections_.
    - [representations](conceptual-model/representations/overview.md) - those collections are visualised via different _representations_.
    - [objects](conceptual-model/objects/overview.md) - each Canvas module is transformed into design and context specific objects through additional data and metadata.
