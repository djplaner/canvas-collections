# Reference - Canvas Collections

!!! note "Out of date"

    Broadly speaking, the following resources will be usable. However, the screenshots and some of the details refer to an older version of Canvas Collections. This will be updated soon.

The features offered by Canvas Collections can be grouped into three categories:

- Collections

    Group Canvas Modules into collections and allow navigation between collections.

- Representations 

    Choose from different visual designs for each collection.

- Objects (modules)

    Transform vanilla Canvas modules into design and context specific objects through additional metadata and affordances.
