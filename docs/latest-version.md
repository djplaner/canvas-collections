# Latest Version **0.8.24**

Canvas Collections remains very much under active development. New versions with new features (and bug fixes) are released weekly. It is recommended to always have [the latest version installed](./getting-started/install/types-pre-requisites.md).

## Current Status

version **0.8.24** of Canvas Collections

- Should work on all Canvas instances, but intended largely for use at Griffith University

    Especially in [individual mode](./getting-started/install/individual.md) mode. However, the date features are currently specific to Griffith University.

- [Institutional mode](./getting-started/install/institutional.md) is not recently tested.

	An early version was tested and worked. A detailed test should be attempted by early 2024.

## Which version are you using?

As shown in the following image, teacher/designer roles can see the version details (circled in red) in the Collections box at the top of the modules page.
