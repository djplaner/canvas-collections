# Configure the collections for a new course

When starting with a new course, the first step in configuring Canvas Collections is to configure the course's collections. As outlined on the [design](design.md) page, the collections are the primary way to organise the course's modules and the sample course is intended to have three collections: Why? What? and How?.

## Go to the course's module view

Canvas Collections typically only works on a Canvas course site's Modules view. So the first step is to go to the Modules view.

## Turn on collections

Next, if Collections is turned off, click the Collections toggle to turn it on.

| Collections off | Collections on |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| ![Collections off](../../getting-started/install/pics/cc_off.png) | ![Collections on](../../getting-started/install/pics/cc_on.png) |

## Open the Collection Configuration area

With Collection's turned on, there will be a small arrow appearing near the Collections' toggle - see the following image.

Clicking on that arrow will open the Collection Configuration area. As shown in the following image, Collection Configuration area has two main parts:

1. _Existing collections_; and,

    Will show the details of any existing collections (if there are any) and provide a way to edit, move, and delete them.
2. _Add a new collection_

    The simple form used to create a new collection for this course.

## Add the first collection

Adding a collection to a course involves completing the _Add a new collection_ form and hitting the **Add** button. To complete the form you need to be able to answer two questions

1. What will the collection's name be?

    The name will be visible to users and should be a short, descriptive, and unique name for the collection.
2. What will the collections's representation be?

    i.e. how will the collection's modules be presented.
