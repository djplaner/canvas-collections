# Institutional

> **Under Construction** The Institutional installation method is currently under development. Early testing confirmed it is possible, but no recent work has been done. Current expectations are that this will change early in 2023.

For now, it is expected most people will use the [Individual Install](individual.md) method.

## How it will work

Canvas Collections is a Javascript application. The [Canvas theme editor](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Video-Guide/Theme-Editor-Admins/ta-p/383021) allows authorised people to include Javascript in a Canvas theme. Meaning that Canvas Collections is an available option for all course sites.

One method to include Canvas Collections would be to use a CDN (e.g. [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/)) version of the Canvas Collections Javascript code (e.g. [this early and not recommended version](https://rawcdn.githack.com/djplaner/canvas-collections/4149e9198561c05bf14a0a45930dd7a0f0b1c7c2/release/canvas-collections.min.js)).

## What might not work

The userscript or [individual version](individual.md) of Canvas Collections includes a number of additional resources that are not yet effectively integrated into the institutional version. Fixing this should not be very complex, but has not yet been completed and tested.
