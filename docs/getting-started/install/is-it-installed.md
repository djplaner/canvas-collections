# Is Collections installed? 

## Pre-requisites for Collections

For you to configure a course to use Canvas Collections you need to 

1. Have [installed Canvas Collections](how-to-install.md)
2. Have a [teacher](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Teacher-role/ta-p/86) or [designer](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Designer-role/ta-p/14) role in a Canvas course.

!!! note "Can you student the _Student View_ button?"

	If you can see the _Student View_ button when viewing the Modules page?
	
	Then Collections considers you have a teacher or designer role. Meaning you can configure Collections.

Then, to see if Collections is installed...

## Go to the Module view of the course site

If all is working, as a teacher or designer you should see the Canvas Collections box appear at the top of the page next to the _Student View_ button, as shown in the following image.

## Turn it on

By default, Canvas Collections is turned off. Use the toggle to turn it on. Initially, you won't see much change, beyond a slight difference in the Collections configuration element.

!!! note "Has to be on to make changes"

	Collections will only modify the Canvas module view when it is turned on.

	What changes you see will depend on
	
	1. What changes have been configured.
	2. If [Collections' visibility setting](../../reference/lifecycle/visibility/live.md) is set appropriately.
