# Getting Started

There are three steps to getting started with Canvas Collections

1. [_Install_ the Canvas Collections code](./install/types-pre-requisites.md).

    Unless you have admin/theme access to your Canvas install you will use [the Individual install](install/individual.md). 

2. [_Configure_ a Canvas course site with Collections](./configure/configuration.md).

    Also see [the walk throughs](../walk-throughs/available.md) for a more detailed example of designing and configuring Canvas Collections for a course site.

3. [_Use_ Collections to navigate the modules view of a Canvas course site](./use/types.md).

    How you use Canvas Collections will depend on the type of install you have.
