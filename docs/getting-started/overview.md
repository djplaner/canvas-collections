# Getting Started

A sequence of common steps to get you started with using Canvas Collections.

| Sequence | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Install Collections](./install/types-pre-requisites.md) | Ensure you can use Collections with your course sites <br> (**Note:** Check below if you need to) |
| [Collections 101](./101/overview.md) | Learn Collections' basics and have a play |
| [Design Collections](./configure/configuration.md) | Design Collections to embody your context and design intent, configure collections with that design |
| [Use Collections](./use/types.md) | Understand the students' experience with Collections |
| [Configure & Use Claytons Collections](./claytons/overview.md) | Use _Claytons_ Collections to create a page with Collections |

!!! tip "Is Collections already installed?"
    When you view the _Modules_ page of your Canvas site as teacher/designer (i.e. you can see the _Student View_ button), do you the _Collections Configuration_ container (circled in red below)?
    
    If so, then Collections is already installed!
