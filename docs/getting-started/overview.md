# Getting Started

There are three steps to getting started with Canvas Collections

1. _Install_ the Canvas Collections code.

    Most will use [the Individual install](install/individual.md), read more about the [Types of and Pre-requisites](install/types.md) for installing Collections.

2. _Configure_ a Canvas course site with Collections.
3. _Use_ Collections to navigate the modules view of a Canvas course site.

Use the menu to the left or the _Next_ button below to work through the three steps.
