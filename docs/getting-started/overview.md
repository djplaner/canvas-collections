=== "Install Collections"

    Canvas Collections is Javascript code that modifies the Canvas modules page. To use Canvas Collections you must first install Collections. There are [two different ways to install Collections](./install/types-pre-requisites.md)

    !!! tip "Is Collections already installed?"

        When you view the _Modules_ page of your Canvas site as teacher/designer (i.e. you can see the _Student View_ button), do you the _Collections Configuration_ container (circled in red below)?
    
        If so, then Collections is already installed!
