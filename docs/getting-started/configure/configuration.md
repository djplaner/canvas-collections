# Configuring Canvas Collections

Configuration of Canvas Collections broadly involves two types:

1. Collections - specifying the course's collections, their order, representation etc.
2. Modules - for each Canvas module specifying which collection they belong to and adding various additional metadata that collections will use.

Each type of configuration has its own interface. The following pages get you started with each. See the [Walk throughs](../../walk-throughs/available.md) and [Reference](../../reference/overview.md) pages for a more detailed examples and description.
