# Concepts - Canvas Collections

Adapted from the [Collections landing page](../../index.md) the following descriptions and videos provide an overview of the primary concepts that make up Canvas Collections and video examples of what they look like as you interact with Canvas with Collections installed.

<!-- === "Canvas Modules"

	Start with a course with 11 modules and a standard Canvas modules page. A long scroll. A need to remember where things are. Little visual distinction beyond use of emojis in module names. Little design or contextual information visible.

=== "collections"

	Canvas Collections allows you to define different _collections_ of Canvas modules. Providing a way to **add structure** to Canvas modules, moving beyond the one linear, vertical list of modules.
	
	In the video below, the 12 modules for a Canvas course (designed to introduce Canvas Collections) are grouped into four specific <em>collections</em> summarised in the table.  
	
	The collection's names - _Why?_, _What?_, _How?_, and _Questions & Suggestions_ - are designed to help students navigate between <em>collections</em>.  </p> <p>Within the Canvas community, this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Modules-within-Modules/idc-p/461383">is a long requested feature (a 2016 request)</a>.  </p> 

	| collection name | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| Why? | Three modules answering the question _why use Collections?_ |
	| What? | Four modules (one unpublished) addressing the question _what is Canvas Collections?_ |
	| How? | Five modules (one unpublished) answering the question _how to use Collections?_ |
	| Questions & Suggestions | No modules, but a padlet is available as a space to ask questions and mark suggestions about Collections. The padlet is embedded in a Canvas page for this course. It has been nominated as this [collection's _include page_](../../reference/conceptual-model/collections/existing-collections.md#include-page), i.e. its content is displayed as part of the collection. |

=== "Representations"

	For each collection, you can select from one of a number of different [_representations_](../../reference/conceptual-model/representations/overview.md). Each representation adds a different _visual_ design to the modules. Moving Modules beyond a sequence of Windows 95 folders. 
	
	The representation for a collection can be changed at any time by selecting another of the available representations. Currently, [there four representations](../../reference/conceptual-model/representations/overview.md#current-representations). New representations can be added.

=== "Objects" 

	For each module, you can provide additional (meta-)data about the module, including a description, date (range), label, banner image etc. This allows you to _add more context_ to the Canvas modules page. Transforming a vanilla Canvas module into a design and context specific <em>object</em>.

=== "Claytons"

	All the previous examples on this page are for _live_ Collections. i.e. the Collections code [is installed](../install/how-to-install.md) and is actively modifying how you are seeing your Canvas site's module page.  This may not always be possible.

	_Claytons_ Collections provides the ability to use the Collections representations on a static Canvas page. Using Claytons collections does **note** require the Collections code to be installed.
	
	_Claytons_ Collections can be used to follow Canvas community best practice to [create an inviting course home page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Creating-an-inviting-course-home-page/ba-p/267236). A home page that can emulate the features of Collections, without requiring Collections.
