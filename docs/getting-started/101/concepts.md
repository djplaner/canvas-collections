# Features - Canvas Collections

Adapted from the [Collections landing page](../../index.md) the following descriptions and videos provide an overview of what Canvas Collections can add to the Canvas Modules page.


=== "Canvas Modules"

	Start with a course with 11 modules and a standard Canvas modules page. A long scroll. A need to remember where things are. Little visual distinction beyond use of emojis in module names. Little design or contextual information visible.

=== "Collections"

	"Collections" is the ability to purposefully group related modules together. For example, this course's 11 modules are now grouped into three, design specific <em>collections</em>. The collection's names - _Why?_, _What?_, and _How?_ - are designed to help students navigate between <em>collections</em>.  </p> <p>Within the Canvas community, this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Modules-within-Modules/idc-p/461383">is a long requested feature (a 2016 request)</a>.  </p>

=== "Representations"

	Each collection can have a different representation. The representation can be changed at any time.  Currently, there is a list of three representations. More can be added.

=== "Objects" 

	Additional metadata has been added to each module (e.g. a description, dates, images, label etc). Transforming a vanilla Canvas module into a design and context specific <em>object</em>.

=== "Claytons"

	Using Collections requires the Collections code to [be installed](../install/types-pre-requisites.md). Not always possible for your students.
	
	If so, Collections' _Claytons_ feature can be used to follow Canvas community best practice to [create an inviting course home page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Creating-an-inviting-course-home-page/ba-p/267236). A home page that can emulate the features of Collections, without requiring Collections.
