# Concepts - Canvas Collections

Adapted from the [Collections landing page](../../index.md) the following descriptions and videos provide an overview of the primary concepts that make up Canvas Collections and video examples of what they look like as you interact with Canvas with Collections installed.

=== "Canvas Modules"

	Start with a course with 11 modules and a standard Canvas modules page. A long scroll. A need to remember where things are. Little visual distinction beyond use of emojis in module names. Little design or contextual information visible.

=== "Collections"

	"Collections" is the ability to purposefully group related modules together. For example, this course's 11 modules are now grouped into three, design specific <em>collections</em>. The collection's names - _Why?_, _What?_, and _How?_ - are designed to help students navigate between <em>collections</em>.  </p> <p>Within the Canvas community, this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Modules-within-Modules/idc-p/461383">is a long requested feature (a 2016 request)</a>.  </p>

=== "Representations"

	Each collection can have a different representation. The representation can be changed at any time.  Currently, there is a list of three representations. More can be added.

=== "Objects" 

	Additional metadata has been added to each module (e.g. a description, dates, images, label etc). Transforming a vanilla Canvas module into a design and context specific <em>object</em>.

=== "Claytons"

	All the previous examples on this page are for _live_ Collections. i.e. the Collections code [is installed](../install/how-to-install.md) and is actively modifying how you are seeing your Canvas site's module page.  This may not always be possible.

	_Claytons_ Collections provides the ability to use the Collections representations on a static Canvas page. Using Claytons collections does **note** require the Collections code to be installed.
	
	_Claytons_ Collections can be used to follow Canvas community best practice to [create an inviting course home page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Creating-an-inviting-course-home-page/ba-p/267236). A home page that can emulate the features of Collections, without requiring Collections.
