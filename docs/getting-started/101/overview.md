# Collections 101

Understanding the conceptual model underpinning Canvas Collections ([like any tool](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/12/conceptual-design-for-interactive-systems-designing-for-performance-and-user-experience.php)) will help you use it effectively and efficiently.

!!! tip "Collections builds on Canvas Modules"

	Meaning an understanding of the conceptual model of Canvas modules is a good starting point. The [How to use Modules to build courses in Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas) resource is a reasonable start.



## How?

This explanation divides the conceptual model into two parts:

=== "Concepts - Collections' building blocks"

	!!! tip "The difference between _**C**ollections_ and _**c**ollections_"

		The use of upper or lower case C is deliberate (and perhaps a touch patchy) in this site, the difference is

		- **C**ollections - refers to _Canvas Collections_, the entire tool.
		- **c**ollections - refers to one or more _collection_ of Canvas modules you create and manage using Collections (the tool).

	Collections is made up of [four main concepts](concepts.md). The below provides a summary. For more detail see the [concepts page](concepts.md).

	| Concept | Description |
	| ---- | ----- |
	| **collections** | Canvas modules are grouped into _collections_ |
	| **representations** | _collections_ can be visualised in different ways using _representations_ |
	| **objects** | By adding more context/design specific information to a Canvas module you can transform it (at least visually) into a context-specific _object_ |
	| **Claytons** | A method to add the Collections' representations to a static Canvas page. Allowing people to use the representation without needing Collections. It is the [Claytons version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytons) of Collections. The Collections you have, when you're not having Collections |

=== "Interface - what will you see?"

	Collections modifies the Canvas modules page by adding two different sets of interface elements. 

	| [Navigation](./interface/navigation.md) | [Configuration](./interface/configuration.md) |
	| ---- | ----- |
	| Used by all people to improve their navigation of Canvas modules. | Used by people with the appropriate permissions to configure Collections. |
