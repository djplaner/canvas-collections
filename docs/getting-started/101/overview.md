# Collections 101

!!! tip "The difference between _**C**ollections_ and _**c**ollections_"

	The use of upper or lower case C is deliberate (and perhaps a touch patchy) in this site, the difference is

	- **C**ollections - refers to _Canvas Collections_, the entire tool.
	- **c**ollections - refers to one or more _collection_ of Canvas modules you create and manage using Collections (the tool).

To learn more about Canvas Collections, learn about

- the [main concepts](concepts.md) that make up Collections;
- how Collections' [navigation](./interface/navigation.md) and [configuration](./interface/configuration.md) interfaces work; and
- the [why, what, and how](why-what-how.md) of Collections.
