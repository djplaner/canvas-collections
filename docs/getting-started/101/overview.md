# Collections 101

Understanding the conceptual model underpinning Canvas Collections ([like any tool](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/12/conceptual-design-for-interactive-systems-designing-for-performance-and-user-experience.php)) will help you use it effectively and efficiently.

!!! tip "Collections builds on Canvas Modules"

	Meaning an understanding of the conceptual model of Canvas modules is a good starting point. The [How to use Modules to build courses in Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas) resource is a reasonable start.

## How?

Collections 101 divides the conceptual model into two parts:

1. [Features](features.md) - the concepts you use to design your use of Collections.
2. [Interface](interface.md) - the tools you use to implement your design.

!!! tip "The difference between _**C**ollections_ and _**c**ollections_"

	The use of upper or lower case C is deliberate (and perhaps a touch patchy) in this site, the difference is

	- **C**ollections - refers to _Canvas Collections_, the entire tool.
	- **c**ollections - refers to one or more _collection_ of Canvas modules, which Collections (the tool) helps you create and manage.

| **Part** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Features](features.md) | Four main features <ol> <li> collections - used to group related modules together; </li> <li> representations - offer different visualisations of a collection and its modules; </li> <li> objects - add more information about modules to transform them into design/context specific objects; and, </li> <li> claytons - modify Canvas page(s) to contain static representations.</li></ol>  |
| [Interface](interface.md) | Identifiable parts of the Collections interface that you will use, includes: <ol> <li> [Cc]ollections Configuration - control the visibility of Collections and create/manage individual collections. </li> <li> [Cc]ollections representation - the main Collections user interface. Displays the collections' navigation bar and the current collection's representation. </li> <li> Module/object configuration - manage the data associated with a module/object. </li> </ol> |
