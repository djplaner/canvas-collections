# Install Canvas Collections

## Installation Types

There are two ways to install Canvas Collections:

### Individual

Installed Canvas Collections in your web browser. As a teacher/designer **you** can configure and use Collections in your Canvas course sites. For your students to use Canvas Collections, you will need to use the "Claytons" Collections method. 

4. Institutionally.

    Installed into your institution's Canvas theme, Canvas Collections can be used by teachers/designers in their Canvas course sites. For students to use Canvas Collections, a teacher/designer must configure the course site using either the "live" or "Claytons" methods.
