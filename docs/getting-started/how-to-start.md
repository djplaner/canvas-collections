# How to start?

Three steps to get started.  

The first two focus on building your understanding of Canvas modules and Canvas Collections.  Understanding the [conceptual model of any tool](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/12/conceptual-design-for-interactive-systems-designing-for-performance-and-user-experience.php) will help you use it effectively and efficiently. 

You may wish to go directly to installing Collections.

Collections builds on Canvas Modules. Having a good understanding of [Canvas modules](https://www.instructure.com/en-au/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas) is a good place to start.
