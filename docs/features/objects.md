# Objects - adding properties to Modules

[Canvas Modules](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas) are designed to group together individual Canvas items and use associated Canvas features. Canvas Modules provide no method by which you can easily add additional properties to a module. For example, you cannot add a date, a label, a picture, or, a description to a module.  Canvas Collections provides this feature. A feature that allows you to transform a generic Canvas Module into a contextually specific object. 

For example, an assignment may typically have a due date and a weighting. A weekly topic might have a start date and [a driving question](https://performingineducation.com/driving-questions/).

### For example

The animated example below demonstrates how additional properties can be added to a Canvas module to modify both how its represented, but also to modify the Canvas Module itself. It proceeds through the following steps:

1. It opens with the _Student View_ of the same Modules page as the other feature examples. It is possible to see how the visible modules have slightly different properties. One has a visible date, some have descriptions, and labels (_Reason 1_).
2. Leaving student view how properties are checked, added, and modified is shown. Only users with appropriate permissions are able to perform this step. Each module has a new _Collections Configuration Section_ configuration section.
3. This interface is then used to add [a description](../reference/objects/overview/#description) to a module and demonstrate how the description immediately appears on the associated representation.
4. [The label property](../references/objects/overview/#labels-and-numbers) is used to identify the type of object a module (e.g. lecture, assignment, topic etc.) represents in the course design. These modules are part of the _Why?_ collection and thus the label used is _ðŸ¤” Reason _. Label's can be manually given numbers (e.g. _ðŸ¤” Reason 1_, _ðŸ¤” Reason 2_ etc.) or auto-numbered based on order.
5. Next [the date attribute](../references/objects/overview/#dates) is set for two of the modules. These dates are based on the academic calendar of the host institution. Automatically translating a generic date (e.g. _Monday Week 1_) to the proper calendar date.
6. Lastly the example demonstrates how [the _apply module labels_ functionality](../collections/overview/#apply-module-labels] combined with labels to modify the names of modules. This feature prepends the label and number to the front of the module name.
