# Canvas Collections Life Cycle

A nascent attempt at documenting the life cycle for Canvas Collections.

## 1. main.ts does the set up

- `CanvasSetup::checkContext` extracts some details about what should be the Canvas course into a `context` object
- If on a Canvas course site's module page it attempts to insert the canvas-collections component in the appropriate place passing the `context` object as properties
- Also sets up an event listener to destroy the canvas-collections component if the page is being unloaded

## 2. Canvas Collections component starts up

- a bunch config variables and imports done
- configStore gets initialised with context variables passed from main.ts
- Attempts to load collections (configuation) and Canvas (modules) details via two classes
  - CollectionsDetails
    - Attempts to load the `Collections Configuration` page
    - Will create an empty one if there isn't one
  - CanvasDetails

### Creation of Collections Configuration page

All the data generated by Collections is stored in a Canvas page named `Canvas Collections Configuration` the lifecycle for this page is as follows.  Implemented by a combination of `CanvasCollections.svelte` and `CollectionsDetails.svelte`

1. (on start up) does config page exist?
2. Read the config page
