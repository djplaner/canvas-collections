# Rationale - Canvas Collections

## Usable short arc design tools that scale

The underpinning rationale for Canvas Collections and related tools is the search for usable, short arc design tools that can scale. Tools that will help higher education deal with the challenge of improving the quality of learning and teaching while faced with reduced funding and increasing complexity.

See the [design principles for Contextually Appropriate Scaffolding Assemblages (Jones, 2019)](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/#initial-design-principles-adr-stage-4) for more.


=== "Short arc design tools"

	Goodyear (2009) provides two contrasting descriptions of how teachers go about design for learning. 

      1. _Long arc_ design - involves a process of thinking, discussing, and searching for course re-design possibilities over a significant, extended period of time. 
      2. _Short arc_ design - reduces that process to a few days and drawing heavily on available tools.  
	
	In a higher education environment where few staff have the time or the support necessary to engage in long arc design, short arc design increasingly becomes the norm. Goodyear (2009) suggests that the best way to influence the practice of short arc design is to embed good ideas in the available tools.

=== "Usable tools"

	Usable tools meet two success criteria - paraphrased from [Brooks (1996, p. 66)](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf):

	1. So _easy_ to use that people _can_ use it.
	2. So _productive_ that people _will_ use it.

=== "Scale as adaptation..."

	Improving the quality of learning and teaching at scale is a key issue for contemporary higher education (Ryan et al, 2021). However, there is a lack of conceptual clarity around scale which Morel and colleagues (2019) seek to address by providing a typology of scale (summarised in the following table)

	| Scale conceptualisation | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| Adoption | Widespread use of an innovation - market share. Limited conceptualisation of expected use.|
	| Replication | Widespread implementation with fidelity that will produce expected outcomes. |
	| Adaptation | Widespread use of an innovation that is modified in response to local needs. | 
	| Reinvention | Intentional and systematic experimentation with an innovation. Innovation as catalyst for further innovation. |

	This work adopts the position of Clark & Dede (2009) that one-size-fits-all approaches don't work in education. No-one design is going to work with fidelity across settings and produce the expected outcomes. Instead, it is essential that designs - like Canvas Collections - are designed to support adaptation and reinvention. That they are generative - the capacity of a technology to generate unprompted change in varied and uncoordinated groups (Zittrain, 2006). Drawing on [Resnick's (2020) metaphor](https://mres.medium.com/designing-for-wide-walls-323bdb4e7277)), Collections aims to provide a:

	- Low floor - easy to get started;
	- High ceiling - enable more advanced usage, including reinvention; and,
	- Wide walls - support for multiple diverse uses (adaptation)
