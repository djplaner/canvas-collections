# Navigating _Claytons_ Collections

!!! question "How do you navigate _Claytons_ Collections?"

	[_Claytons_ Collections](../reference/conceptual-model/collections/full-claytons.md) is where Collections has been used to [generate full navigation using pages](https://lisahistory.net/wordpress/2020/06/working-against-canvas-three-tips/). i.e. it creates static HTML representations of the Collections' navigation interface on a [normal Canvas page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Pages/ta-p/5) 

	1. What does _Claytons_ Collections look like? What navigation elements are there?
	2. How do you use _Claytons_ Collections to navigate a course's modules?
	    - How do you switch between collections?
	    - How do you navigate to a specific module?

!!! warning "_Claytons_ may not always be up to date"

	_Claytons_ Collections is a static representation of the collections. It is not automatically updated when changes are made to either a course's modules or Collections configuration. This means that _Claytons_ may not always be up to date. 

	Hence it is important for the teacher/designer using Claytons to update the Claytons view when other changes are made. 

	‚ùó This includes after a course copy


=== "What does it look like?"

	_Claytons_ Collections provides almost all the same navigation elements as _Live_ Collection. There are two differences:

	1. The representation is done using static HTML, no live code.
	2. As it is displayed on a normal Canvas page, there is no list of Canvas modules.

	    Instead, clicking on the _Engage_ button will navigate to the Modules view whether the module is available.

=== "How do you switch between collections?"

	In _Claytons_ Collections, switching between collections is also done with the navigation bar.  However, as it provides none of the smarts of the _Live_ version.

=== "How do you navigate to a module"

	Navigating to a module from _Claytons_ Collections involves clicking on one of the module representations. This will navigate to the Modules view with the chosen module immediately visible.

	One way to return to the _Claytons_ page would be to hit the browser back button.
