# Setting up Claytons Collections

!!! question "How do you improve navigation when you can't use _live_ Collections?"

    _Live_ Collections only works if the code is installed. For students, this should be done institutionally. Not easy for all.

    If you can't use _live_ Collections, you can use _Claytons_ Collections to modify a Canvas page with an interface like Collections.

Assuming you've already [configured Collections](./overview.md) for your course, setting up Claytons Collections involves the following steps.

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1. How many collections? | <p>You can include some or all of your course's collections in Claytons.</p> |
| 2. What Canvas pages? | <p>Claytons Collections writes representations of one or more collections to one or more pages. You can have multiple collections on one page, one collection on multiple pages, or some combination</p> |
| 3. Configure Claytons | <p>Use the Collections configuration element to specify which collections go to which Canvas pages. </p> |
| 4. Generate Claytons | <p>Update the chosen pages with the current representation of the chosen collections.</p> |

!!! tip "Repeat the last step every time you make a change to Collections"

    Without this step, the Claytons pages will not reflect the changes you've made to Collections.

## For example

These tabs demonstrate one example of stepping through the four steps from the table above. 

=== "Collections versus Claytons"

    These steps convert a (live or normal) Collections configuration into a Claytons Collections. Use the image comparer below to examine the live Collections with the final Claytons Collections that is generated by this example.

    !!! tip "Use the slider"

        Drag the slider to the left or right to see more/less of the images.

    <figure markdown>
    <figcaption><em>Live</em> Collections to be emulated with <em>Claytons</em></figcaption>
    <sl-image-comparer>
        <img slot="after" src="../images/afterCollections.gif" alt="Live Collections to be emulated with Claytons">
        <img slot="before" src="../images/afterClaytons.gif" alt="Claytons version">
    </sl-image-comparer>
    </figure>


=== "1. How many collections?"

    For the example course used here, the aim is produce a new home page that fully emulates _live_ Collections.
    
    As shown in the image below, the example course has four collections. We want to use all four: _Why?_, _What?_, _How?_, and _Questions & Suggestions_.

    <figure markdown>
    <figcaption>The four collections for this live Collections</figcaption>
    <img src="../images/fourCollections.png" alt="Four collections for this live Collections" />
    </figure>



=== "2. What Canvas pages?"

    To emulate _live_ Collections, we need to place all the collections into a single page. The aim being is that this page will become the new home page for the course.

    Hence, the new Claytons Canvas page will be called _New Home Page_. A page that doesn't exist yet in the course.
    
=== "3. Configure Claytons"

    The main configuration required is to specify the _output page_ for each collection. The _output page_ is the name of the Canvas page to which the collection's representation will be written.

    In this example, since we want each collection to be represented in Claytons Collections, the name of an output page (_New Home Page_) is provided for each collection. Only add output pages for the collections you wish to include in the Claytons version.

    !!! info "You can use different pages for different Claytons"

        In this example, Claytons Collections has all collections going to the same page. It is possible to use different pages for different collections.

    <sl-animated-image src="../images/configureClaytons.gif" alt="Configure Claytons by specifying the output page for Collections">
    </figure>

=== "4. Generate Claytons"

    With everything configured, the final step is to generate the Claytons pages. This is done using the **Full "Claytons"** section of the collections configuration element. The main task is to choose [the _Navigation Bar Option_](../../reference/conceptual-model/representations/claytons/overview.md#navigation-bar-options) most appropriate.

    For the example, the aim is to emulate _live_ Collections. Making _Tabs_ the best navigation bar option.

    Once the option is chosen, Collections will create the page (if necessary) and update its content with static HTML.
