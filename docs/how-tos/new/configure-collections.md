# Configure the collections for a course

!!! questions "How do you use Collections to configure collections for a course?"

    You've completed the [design](./design.md) step and now you need to configure the collections for your course. 
    
    How do you do it?
    
The following illustrates the process using the example course from the [design](./design.md) step. It assumes you've 

1. Already installed Canvas Collections.
2. Are the teacher/designer for a Canvas course with existing modules.
3. Have navigated to the Modules view of the course.

The process illustrated is summarised in the following table.

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1. Turn on Collections | <p>Initially, Collections is turned off for a course. The first time you start using Collections on a course you must turn it on</p> |
| 2. Turn on editing | <p>Once Collections is turned on you will be able to see Collections navigation interface elements. Before any configuration takes place, this is likely to be quite bare.</p> <p>Before you can make any changes you must turn _Edit on_. At any one time, only one person in one browser window can be editing Collections for a given course. </p> |
| 3. Add a new collection | <p>With _Edit on_ you can start adding new collection(s) by providing a collection name and choosing an initial representation.</p>  |
| 4. Check the collection | <p>Optionally, once created you can check that it has been created.</p>|

=== "1. Turn on collections"

    On the Modules page, if Collections is installed, you will see the Collections element. If Collections has not been previously turned on for the course, you will see a switch. Click that switch to turn Collections on.

=== "2.  Turn on editing"

    Any any one time, only one person can edit Collections for a course. Before you can make changes - like adding a new collection - you must turn _Edit on_

    !!! warning "Students can't see an _unpublished_ Collections"

        The newly created Collections configuration (just a normal Canvas page) will be _unpublished_. This means students will not be able to use _live_ Collections.  You need to publish it before they can.

        Collections inline help provides more detail (see the animated image below for more)

=== "3. Add a collection"

    With _Edit on_ you can start adding new collection(s) by providing a collection name and choosing an initial representation.

	<figure markdown>
	<figcaption>Add a collection</figcaption>
	<sl-animated-image src="../images/addCollection.gif" alt="Add a collection">
	</figure>

=== "4. Check the collection (and goto 3)"

    Once created you can check what's been created and/or you can continue to add more collections.

	<figcaption>Check and add all collections</figcaption>
