# New course: before and after

The _new course_ walk through demonstrates how to use Canvas Collections to take a Canvas course site from the before state to the after state.

## Before

This Canvas Course was designed to introduce an early version of Canvas Collections. It contains 13 modules as illustrated in the following animated GIF.

## After

Once Canvas Collections is configured, the Modules view will have those 13 modules organised ito three collections organised around three essential driving questions for Canvas Collections:

1. Why?
2. What?
3. How?

Each collection will use a Card representation. Meaning that each module will be represented by a card with a title, description and image. 

Students will be able to navigate between collections and use the cards to access the modules.
