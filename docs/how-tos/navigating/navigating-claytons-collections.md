# Navigating _Claytons_ Collections

_Claytons_ Collections generates collections' representations on a [normal Canvas page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Pages/ta-p/5) (i.e. not on the Modules view). This creates some differences with _Live_ Collections, but the same two navigtation tasks apply:

1. Switching between collections.
2. Navigating to a module

!!! "warning" _Claytons_ may not always be up to date

	_Claytons_ Collections is a static representation of the collections. It is not automatically updated when changes are made to either a course's modules or Collections configuration. This means that _Claytons_ may not always be up to date.
