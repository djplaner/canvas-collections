# Navigating _Claytons_ Collections

_Claytons_ Collections generates collections' representations on a [normal Canvas page](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Pages/ta-p/5) (i.e. not on the Modules view). This creates some differences with _Live_ Collections, but the same two navigtation tasks apply:

1. Switching between collections.
2. Navigating to a module

!!! warning "_Claytons_ may not always be up to date"

	_Claytons_ Collections is a static representation of the collections. It is not automatically updated when changes are made to either a course's modules or Collections configuration. This means that _Claytons_ may not always be up to date. 

	Hence it is important for the teacher/designer using Claytons to update the Claytons view when other changes are made.


=== "_Claytons_ Navigation Elements"

	_Claytons_ Collections provides almost all the same navigation elements as _Live_ Collection. There are two differences:

	1. The representation is done using static HTML, no live code.
	2. As it is displayed on a normal Canvas page, there is no list of Canvas modules.

	    Instead, clicking on the _Engage_ button will navigate to the Modules view whether the module is available.

=== "Switching between collections"

	In _Claytons_ Collections, switching between collections is also done with the navigation bar.  However, as it provides none of the smarts of the _Live_ version.

=== "Navigating to a module"

	Navigating to a module from _Claytons_ Collections involves clicking on one of the module representations. This will navigate to the Modules view with the chosen module immediately visible.

	One way to return to the _Claytons_ page would be to hit the browser back button.
