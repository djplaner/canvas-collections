# Canvas Collections

Transform your learners' experience of your Canvas course site by adding more context and design specific properties and functionality. Leverage this to improve your site's information architecture and visual design (see the comparison images below). 

## Comparing Vanilla Canvas to Canvas + Collections

Both of the following images are of the Module page of the same Canvas course site.

The comparison demonstrates the three core features of Collections.

### Collections

The vanilla Canvas view is a list of 11 modules. The Collections view has those same 11 modules divided into three collections titled: Why? What? and How?. The purpose of this site is to introduce Canvas Collections. The collection titles are chosen to fit that purpose meaningfully. Each collection (and its modules) can be viewed separately. 

### Representations 

Each collection is using a _card_ representation (one of available representations). A [card user interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/) is a common contemporary interface with known benefits, including its visual capability and responsiveness. 

### Objects 

Each module has had an image and a description added. Both add more context and sign-posting to aid the student in understanding the purpose of the module.
