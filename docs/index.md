# Canvas Collections

Transform your learners' experience of your course site by improving your site's information architecture and visual design by using the three three key features Collections adds to Canvas:

1. Collections - group Canvas modules according to your design.
2. Representations - transform the visual design of the Canvas module interface.
3. Objects - add metadata and affordances to generic Canvas modules to transform that into objects that fit your design and context.

The [Features page](features.md) provides more detail and examples of each of these feature. 

### Comparing Vanilla Canvas to Canvas Collections

Both of the following images are of the Module's view of the same Canvas course site with 11 mondules.

The left hand image shows the default Canvas interface. A long scroll down the 11 modules.

The right hand image adds Canvas Collections with three collections titled: Why? What? and How?. Each collection can be navigated to separately. Each collection is using a _card_ representation. Hence collections adds a card for each module. Each module has had an image and a description added to help explain the purpose of the module.
