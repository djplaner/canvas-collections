# Canvas Collections


When your students visit your Canvas course's [module view](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-Modules-as-a-student/ta-p/433), how easy is it for them to answer the following questions:

4. Which course was this again? How did it structure the modules?
1. What is this module for? Why will I do it? What's the purpose?
2. When should I be thinking of engaging with it?
3. Where in the list of modules was the Assignment 2 module?

Canvas Collections makes it possible to re-design the Canvas module view to make it easier for students to answer these questions. It does this by allowing you to add more context and design specific properties and functionality to the modules view. 

## What does it look like?

Both of the following images are of the Module page of the same Canvas course site. The Collections version has more context and design specific properties added. For example, each module has an image and a description meaning that the visual design and information architecture of the course site is more explicit. If done well, leading to a better student experience.

| Vanilla Canvas | Canvas Collections (live) |

The comparison demonstrates the three core features of Collections.

### Collections

The vanilla Canvas view is a list of 11 modules. The Collections view has those same 11 modules divided into three collections titled: Why? What? and How?. The purpose of this site is to introduce Canvas Collections. The collection titles are chosen to fit that purpose meaningfully. Each collection (and its modules) can be viewed separately. 

### Representations 

Each collection is using a _card_ representation (one of available representations). A [card user interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/) is a common contemporary interface with known benefits, including its visual capability and responsiveness. 

### Objects 

Each module has had an image and a description added. Both add more context and sign-posting to aid the student in understanding the purpose of the module.
