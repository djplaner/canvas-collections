# Canvas Collections

Transform your learners' experience of your Canvas course site by improving your site's information architecture and visual design (see the comparison images below) by using Canvas Collection's three three key features:

1. Collections - group Canvas modules into context and design specific collections.
2. Representations - transform the visual design of each collection in appropriate ways.
3. Objects (activities) - transform generic Canvas modules into context and design specific objects/activities by adding metadata and affordances.

Use the following table as a map for what the rest of this site has to offer.

## Comparing Vanilla Canvas to Canvas Collections

Both of the following images are of the Module's view of the same Canvas course site with 11 modules.

### Vanilla Canvas

The left hand image shows the vanilla Canvas interface. A long scroll down the 11 modules. Each module is represented with a clear, but boring and generic list of names of modules and items. With a few icons thrown in.

### Canvas Collections

The right hand image shows the same course site with Canvas Collections (live version). It demonstrates the features of Collections in the following ways:

1. Collections - the 11 modules are divided into three collections titled: Why? What? and How?. The purpose of this site is to introduce Canvas Collections. The collection titles are chosen to fit that purpose meaningfully. Each collection can be navigated separately. 
2. Representations - each collection is using a _card_ user interface. One of three (more to come) representations available. A [card user interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/) is a common contemporary interface with known benefits, including its visual capability and responsiveness. Changing representations is done by selecting from those available.
3. Objects - each module has had an image and a description added. Both add more context and sign-posting to aid the student in understanding the purpose of the module.
