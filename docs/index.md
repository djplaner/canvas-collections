# Canvas Collections

Transform your learners' experience of your course site by improving your site's information architecture and visual design by using the three three key features Collections adds to Canvas:

1. Collections - group Canvas modules according to your design.
2. Representations - transform the visual design of the Canvas module interface.
3. Objects - add metadata and affordances to generic Canvas modules to transform that into objects that fit your design and context.

The [Features page](features.md) provides more detail and examples of each of these feature. 

The following animated images offer a comparison between the Modules view of the same Canvas course. On the left using vanilla Canvas. On the right using Canvas Collections.
