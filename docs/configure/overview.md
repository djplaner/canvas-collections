# Configure Collections

Learn how to configure Collections for your course.

## Compare before with after configuration

It can be useful to start by understanding what a Canvas course site will look like [before and after Collections is configured](../configure/before-and-after.md). 

## Sample configuration process

Step through the sample 4-step configuration process:

1. [Design](../configure/design.md) - design how your course site will use Collections.
2. [Configure collections](../configure/configure-collections.md) - based on your design configure the collections for your course.
3. [Configure objects](../configure/configure-modules.md) | - based on your design configure the objects (add the meta-data for each module).
4. [Configure representations](../configure/configure-representations.md) - choose the initial representations best suited to your course's collections.

## Set up 'Claytons'

Finally, you may need to [Set up 'Claytons'](../configure/set-up-claytons.md) - Configure Collections to create/update static Canvas page(s) for your course.
