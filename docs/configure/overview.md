# Configure Collections

Once Collections is [installed](../getting-started/install/is-it-installed.md) (and you have a teacher/designer role) you will be able to configure Collections for your course.  The following offers one process for configuring Collections.

## Before and after configuration

It can be useful to start by understanding what a Canvas course site will look like [before and after Collections is configured](../configure/before-and-after.md). 

## Suggested configuration process

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. [Design](../configure/design.md) | How best to use Collections for your course. |
| 2. [Configure collections](../configure/configure-collections.md) | Create and configure the collections required by your course. |
| 3. [Configure objects](../configure/configure-modules.md) | Identify the objects that make up the collections and identify the additional (meta-)data for each module to transform them into the identified objects. |
| 4. [Configure representations](../configure/configure-representations.md) | Choose the representations best suited to your course's collections. |

## Set up 'Claytons'

Once Collections is configured, you may also wish to [set up 'Claytons'](../configure/set-up-claytons.md).
