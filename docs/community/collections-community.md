# Canvas Collections Community

Canvas Collections has only been possible due to the Canvas and Griffith University communities. They've provided the motivation, support, and [related work](./related-work.md) that has made this possible. The value Collections can provide will be proportional to the quality of the community which contributes to it.

## How to contribute

It's still early days. Here are the current suggestions.

### People using Collections

If you've got a question or a suggestion, the [discussions area](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections/discussions) is probably the best place to start.

If you've found a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections/issues).

But when in doubt, start a [discussion](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections/discussions).

### People developing Collections

For now, the above advice applies. You may also want to reach out to [the Collections maintainer directly](https://github.com/djplaner). Beyond that, there'll be more development resources coming here RSN.
