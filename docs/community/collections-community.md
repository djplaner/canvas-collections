# Collections Community

## Building on the shoulders of giants

Collections has only been possible due to the Canvas, Griffith University, and broader open source communities. They've provided the motivation, support, [related work](../about/related-work.md), knowledge, and tools that made Collections possible. 

üôè Thank you.

=== "Modifying Collections?"

	Collections is open source. Licence update coming soon. It is explicitly designed to be easy to be modified to suit your context and requirements. It's hosted on GitHub, feel free to fork it and make changes. If you do, please consider contributing them back to the project.

	**Getting started with Collections development**

	The [Collections readme](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections#canvas-collections) provides some [very basic information](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections#for-the-developers) on how to get started with Collections development. More to come, hopefully.

	If you've questions, please use [the discussions area](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-collections/discussions) of reach out to [the Collections maintainer directly](https://github.com/djplaner). 

	**Possible modifications**

	| Possibility | Description |
	| ---- | ----- |
	| Write a new representation | <p>[Representations](../../reference/conceptual-model/representations/overview/) are the most visual aspect of Collections. They are designed as stand alone Svelte components. Meaning it is fairly easy to create new representations to suit your needs.</p> |
	| Improve an existing representation | <p>e.g. modify the Cards representation to include a drop-down of module items on the card.</p> |
	| Improve date handling | <p>Currently date handling is very specific to Griffith. It needs further abstraction to more easily support other institutions and their calendars.</p><p>There's also an argument to be made for adding a standard calendar entry method.</p> |
	| Fix bugs | <p>There will be bugs. Please, find them, report them, and if possible fix them.</p>|
	| Write tests | <p>Collections is currently without a testing framework. This needs to change.</p> |
