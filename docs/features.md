# Features



## Collections - grouping modules by design

Standard Canvas provides a single list of Modules. You can change the order of the modules, but that's it. This causes problems if you have more than a few modules. The ability to create groups of modules is a [long requested feature](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Modules-within-Modules/idc-p/461383) which is [not being provided by the vendor](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Idea-Conversations/Modules-within-Modules/idc-p/461383/highlight/true#M50428). 

Canvas Collections allows you to group modules into different **collections** (e.g. Content, Assessment). It displays a navigation bar that allows students to navigate between different collections, seeing and interacting only with the modules belonging to the visible collection.

## Representations - enhancing the visual design of modules

THe visual design of Canvas' modules view is linear and while visually clean it is somewhat uninteresting. A [common solution](https://learntech.medsci.ox.ac.uk/wordpress-blog/a-dashboard-view-of-modules-in-canvas/) to this within the Canvas community is to manually create a Canvas page to provide a more effective and purposefully design (e.g. ["Creating an inviting course home page"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Creating-an-inviting-course-home-page/ba-p/267236); and, ["Home Sweet Homepages without Tables"](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Home-Sweet-Homepages-without-Tables/ba-p/275079))

Canvas Collections provides different **representations** of the Module view. Each **collection** can be configured to use a different **representation**. The chosen **representation** can be changed at any time.

## Objects/activities - adding metadata and affordances to Modules

[Canvas Modules](https://www.instructure.com/canvas/resources/all/how-to-use-modules-to-build-courses-in-canvas) are a vanilla tool intended to help structure course content by representing the objects/activities at the centre of your learning design (e.g. day, week, unit, topic, assignment, lecture etc.). 

Objects/activities that will typically has a range of additional information about them that needs representing. For example, a lecture or week might be occurring on a particular date/time. Most objects/activities will have a purpose/rationale that would be beneficial for students to know.

Transform your modules from Canvas' generic feature into context and design specific objects
