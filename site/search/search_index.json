Small Javascript programs that your browser will run when you view specific web pages. Userscripts customise those web pages to better suit your purposes. e.g. to modify the Canvas modules view by adding Collections. Once you've completed installation, you can test if it is working . Install a userscript manager - TamperMonkey TamperMonkey is a widely used userscript manager. It can be used on most modern web browsers. Visit the Tampermonkey home page .

It provides two methods you can use : Update a single page using the output page Update multiple pages using Full Claytons Typically, this is used to place each collection's representation onto its own page. For example, the following animated image that shows the process of placing the representations for three collections ( Why? , What? , and How? ) onto three separate pages (with the same names). The following shows how you can place the representations for these same three collections ( Why? , What? , and How? ) onto a single page. The Process The process for doing this is almost the same as used on the setting up Claytons Collections page . Configure Canvas Collections How many collections for Claytons? \ud83c\udd95 How many pages? Create (or identify) the page(s) required. Set up the page(s) Specify the collection's output page Use Collections to update the pages Once the basics are setup, you can also make it fancy Configure Canvas Collections This only works if Collections is configured for your course. The example here will be using the same course and Collections configuration as the previous example . How many collections for Claytons? As with the previous example the following will use all three available collections. You can choose as many as you like, but since the aim is to include the representations from multiple collections, you'll need at least two. \ud83c\udd95 How many pages? Previously, the example used a single page for each collection. This time, the example will use a single page for all three collections. If you're are using less than one page per per collection, you'll need to perform the \"set up the page(s)\" step below. Create (or identify) the page(s) required. Currently, Collections will not create the pages for you. You'll need to be sure that all the required Canvas pages exist. Set up the page(s) - add each collection's output div Background When Claytons Collections updates a Canvas page it places the HTML for that collections' representation into a HTML tag - a common why to group related HTML. Apart from the HTML, the tag also has an identifier unique to the collection and Claytons Collections. For example, the following image shows the HTML for the How? page from the previous example where the How? page contained the representation for the How? collection. In the image, the tag identifier has been circled in red <div id=\"cc-output-How?\"> . The first part of the identifier is consistent cc-output- for Canvas Collections output. The last part of the identifier is the name of the collection How? . One div per collection If you want to have the representation of more than one collection on a single page OR if you want to specify exactly where the representation is placed on the page, you'll need to add a tag for each collection. For this example, all three collections will be placed on a single page titled All together with the following order: Why? , What? , and How? . The following image shows the HTML for the All together page with the tags and identifiers added. Specify the collection's output page As with the previous example, the output page for each collection needs to be specified. This time, the output page for each collection will be the All together page. As illustrated in the following image. Use Collections to update the pages There are two options that could be used to update the pages: update the output page; or, Full Claytons . Full Claytons has the advantage of doing all collections at once. However, it as the current disadvantage of adding a navigation bar - which is not necessary as we're only using a single page. Hence the approach shown in the following animated image uses the update output page option. The image shows that each collection can be updated and its results checked before proceeding. Make it fancy With all this set up, you now have a Canvas page into which you can update the collections' representations. At the moment, the page just has each representation one after the other, you may want to make it a bit fancier than that by, for example Adding a title for each collection. Turning each collection into an accordion. Or some other idea you can translate into HTML. Adding a title for each collection All that's need to achieve this is to edit the All together page and place appropriate headings between each collection's representation.

Introducing the module configuration area For teachers and designers, Canvas Collections adds a module specific configuration area to each Module. This is how you configure each module. Find the module configuration area Each module's configuration area will be visible (to teachers and designers) just under the module title - circled in red below. By default the module configuration area is closed. Open the module configuration area As with the Collections configuration area, you open the module configuration area by clicking on the small arrow. This will open the module configuration area and reveal the module's metadata. The following image shows an early version of the module configuration area, currently the major areas of the module configuration area, includes: Collection - used to specify which collection the module belongs to. Label - three elements (label, auto-number, and number) used to specify the module's label and number. Date - specify the date for the module using three elements - day of week; week; and time. Image - associate an image with the module and how it should be scaled to fit with a card. Description - provide a short description or rationale for the module. Additional metadata - add and remove additional metadata in the form of name/value pairs. Use these form elements to set and change the module configuration. Allocate the modules The Collections element will contain a list of the current collections. Use the menu to choose one. When you change the collection allocation for a module, your view of Collections will change in a number of ways.

It is not visible when viewing the What? collection. Module is represented using the collection's representation The Why? collection was configured to use the GriffithCards representation. Hence the newly allocated module is represented as a card - a rather bare card. Module configuration area lists the allocated collection The allocated module now shows Why? as it's collection. Allocate the remaining modules Once all the modules are allocated to collections, the Collections configuration Existing collections section looks like the following: 3 modules in Why? ; 5 modules in What? ; and, 5 modules in How? . The following animated image shows the rest of the interface once all modules are allocated to collections. Some points to note Some modules remain unpublished . The cards representation adds a warning (visible to teachers and designers) identifying unpublished modules. These will not be visible to students. Navigation between the three collections works as expected. Clicking on the Engage button on a Card brings that module to focus. The cards are all relatively blank with limited metadata (e.g. images, descriptions etc) Time to add some additional metadata. Specify additional metadata As mentioned above, the additional metadata that can be added includes the following list. Each with its own form elements. The following walk-through gives an example of each. Note: As soon as metadata is changed, the module's representation will be updated. | Metadata | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | Description | Some HTML intended to provide students with a description or rationale for the object represented by the module | | Image | A visual image to represent the module | | Label & Number | Explicitly identify a module as a particular object (the label) and its position in the collection (the number - which can be auto calculated) | | Date & Date Label | Specify the day/time when the activity occurs, is due etc. Through a combination of a date and a label (e.g. due, commencing etc) | | Additional metadata | A flexible method for specifying any additional metadata in the form of pairs of name and value | Add a description The description is best used to provide students with additional information about what, why and how they might engage with the activities and information contained by a module. The description is a relative short piece of text entered using a simple visual editor under the description heading of the module configuration area.

It is a way to use Collections' features without students and others having access to Collections. Setting up Claytons Collections involves the following steps: Configure Canvas Collections for your course site. Decide how many Collections you'll configure with Claytons. Create a Canvas page for each Collection. Specify the collection's output page. Use Collections to update the pages. The last step is one you repeat every time you make a change to Collections. Configure Canvas Collections The Configure Collections walk through steps through this process. This example will use the Canvas course configured in that walk through an pictured below. It has three collections: Why? , What? , and How? . How many collections for Claytons? Claytons Collections is simply a method of copying the representation of a single Collection (e.g. Why? ) to a matching Canvas page. Hence, an early decisions is how many and which of your course's collections you wish to use with Claytons. In this example, all three will be used. Create (or identify) a Canvas page for each Collection Since Claytons copies a representation of a collection to a Canvas page, each collection needs a matching Canvas page. Use the standard process for creating a Canvas page . Use any name you like for each page, common advice would include: Using the same name as the collection will reinforce the information architecture and possibly minimise confusion. If you wish students to see the page, it will need to be published. Using existing pages is fine. Collections will not overwrite any existing content on the page. By default it will add the collections' representation to the bottom of the page. The following image shows that this advice as been followed. There are three new pages, each matching the three collections in the example. Each page has been published. Specify the collection's output page This step links a collection to the page that was just created, enabling it be updated. It is done using the Collections configuration dialog and requires that you enter the name of the appropriate page as the Output Page . for a collection. The following image shows progress in specifying the output pages for the example course. The Output page sections have been circled in red. The Why? collection has had its output page specified and there is a matching Update button. The What? collection has had its output page entered, but not yet finished. This is why there is no Update button. Use Collections to update the pages There are two methods for updating the pages: Update the output page for a single collection; or, Full \"Claytons\". Update the output page Used to update a single collection's output page. Will not include the collection's navigation bar. Is done by clicking the Update button next to a collection's Output page . Full \"Claytons\" The \"Full Claytons\" differs from \"update\" in two ways: All output pages are updated. Each output page will contain the collection's representation AND a navigation bar that enables navigation between the pages. \"Full Claytons\" has its own Update button in the Collections configuration dialog. Click this and Collections will update each page in turn. The following image looks at each individual page before applying \"Full Claytons\". Showing the pages don't have any content. It then shows the process of applying \"Full Claytons\". Then it revisits one of the pages and reloads the page to see the updated content.
