Design (e.g. that the module is a lecture or assessment) and context specific (e.g. the date it is due) information can be added to the module name. But this is limited and manual. A key feature of Collections is the ability to specify additional metadata and functionality for Canvas modules as a way to transform them into design and context specific objects. To better support and visually express your course's learning design. Description A description of the object that will be displayed in most representations to provide students with a way to answer what, why, how or some other question about the module. How (and perhaps if) the description is shown to the student will depend on the relevant collection's representation. Banner The card design for Collection's cards representation uses the idea of a banner as the top part of the card (i.e. the top section of the card circled in red in the following image). Typically used to provide a visual representation of the module, contributing to the overall visual design of the course, and possibly helping students build conceptual associations. As illustrated in the following image, there are three common types of banner: Image - the URL of an image is provided and is displayed in the banner. By default, the banner is set to a default image. 2. Iframe - an iframe (aka HTML embed code) - e.g. a YouTube embed. (The second card in the image below has a YouTube video banner which is currently not displaying) 3. Colour - the banner background is set to a single colour. Configuring the banner You are able to configure 0 or more of the banner options. By default, a new module will be configured to use a placeholder image. The banner option that is current visible in the module configuration area will be the option used on the matching card - as illustrated in the following animated image. Some representations ignore the banner options Currently, on the Griffith Cards representation actively uses the banner options. The following animated image steps through the following: Showing a card representation of a module (using an iframe banner) and its corresponding configuration. Illustrates how when the current banner choice is changed from image to iframe to colour how the card representation changes to match. Image Images are specified by two pieces of metadata: Image url - the web location where the image can be viewed. Image scale - how the image should be scaled to fit within the available space. Image url Designed to contain either: The URL for an image to be displayed. See the Image URL section of the Configure Modules walk-through for more information, including demonstration of how to get the URL of an image in the Canvas files area. The embed code for an iframe (e.g. a YouTube/Vimeo/Stream/Studio etc video) Copy and paste the full embed code from a video-hosting (or some other) service and it will be embedded where the image would normally appear. Image scale For an iframe, Image Scale is ignored. Instead, iframes are automatically set to use width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" to ensure they are scaled to fit the available space. For an image, Image scale modifies the scaling of the image using the standard CSS property called object-fit . The following table outlines the possible values for object-fit. These values appear in the Image scale drop down when configuring a module. See the Image Scale section of the Configure Modules walk-through for more information, including an animation of the impact of the different values. Value Description cover The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is cropped to fit the available space. contain The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. fill The image is scaled to fill the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is cropped to fit the available space. fit The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. none The image is not scaled. scale-down The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. Iframe The iframe banner option allows you to copy and paste a HTML iframe element . Meaning you're able to embed other web content such as another web page, but more commonly a video (e.g. from YouTube or Studio). Collections will perform some checks on the iframe code and will modify it to work within the context of a card. The following animated image demonstrates the process of using the iframe banner option. Before starting, a public embed code (aka iframe) for a Canvas Studio video was created and then copied into the clipboard. The image shows the process from there, including: Moving to the Module's configuration area. Opening the banner section and moving to the iframe option. Pasting the video iframe code into the available text area and resizing the text area to better see the code. Reading the alert box Collections generates when it detects a change in the iframe code. A return to the module to view the video and press play. Colour The colour banner option allows you to choose a fixed colour for the banner. This has proven useful in situations where a module represents a topic/purposes for which no photo or video is available or suitable. The colour is chosen using a colour picker - as demonstrated in the following animated image. FYI A way to specify that a module should become a For Your Information (FYI) only object. i.e. any representation will only display Collections' information (label, number, description, banner etc). It should not display any information about the actual Canvas module, including a link to the module. FYI object's - since they don't display any information about the Canvas module - are always displayed. Regardless of whether the module is unpublished or generally not available to the student. Labels and Numbers Many course designs use modules to represent common objects (e.g. lectures, tutorials, workshops, assessments, themes, topics etc.). Often a course will have multiple such objects (e.g. topic 1, topic 2, topic 3). Labels and numbers provide a means to explicitly identify such objects and their sequence. This information is used in different ways by each representation. Collections provides the ability for you to explicitly specify the number for each module OR it can auto calculate the number based on the module's position in the collection. Engage Button Card representations can include an Engage button as an explicit affordance for the visitor to click on the card. When configuring the Engage button you can choose to: Turn the button on or off. Even if the Engage button is turned off, the visitor can still click on a normal card to access the module. (unless it is an FYI object for which the Engage button is always off). Change the button text. The following animated image demonstrates the process of configuring the Engage button, including: turning off the Engage button; turning it back on again; changing the label; and, finally returning back to the default. Dates Collections allows you to specify the date, time, or date/time range. In a University context, such dates are typically given with reference to a given study period (aka semester, trimester, study session etc.). For example, Monday Week 1 of Trimester 1 will be a different date for Monday Week 1 of Trimester 2. This commonly leads to two strategies: Generic dates - specify the date in a study period independent way (e.g. \"Week 1\", \"Week 2\", \"Week 3\" etc.). No upkeep is required, but students are expected to translate the generic dates into specific calendar dates. Specific dates - specify the actual calendar date (e.g. 1st March). Requires manual updating each study period, but students can easily see the specific date. Collections can take on the task of translating generic dates into calendar specific dates. It identifies the study period for the current course site and translates a generic date into the appropriate specific date based on the institution's academic calendar. Dates is workable, but under construction Currently, dates can only be specified using generic dates and Griffith University study periods. Study Period At Griffith University, the course code typically includes a term code. A four digital number identifying the study (aka teaching) period. Collections attempts to extract the term code from the course code, which is then used to map generic dates to specific calendar dates. If the term code cannot be extracted, Collections defaults to the current study period. See the Griffith course id explanation page for more information about term codes. Collections will display the label - circled in red in the following image - for the study period it is using to generate calendar dates. Date types As summarised in the following table, the date area of the Module configuration dialog allows you to specify dates for three different purposes. Date type Purpose Start Date Either a one-off date or the start date of a date range Stop Date The end date of a date range All three date types are available from the same space via a tabbed interface. As illustrated by the following animated image, each date type provides a similar (but not the same) interface. Start Date Start date can specify either a one-off date or the start of a date range. The following table summarises the values you can specify for a start date. Value Default value Description Date label Commencing A text label that will be added before the date (range). e.g. \"Starts\" or \"Due\". Day of week Not Chosen The full name of the day of the week for the date Week Not Chosen The number of the week within the study period in which the date occurs. Time The time of day (if any) for the date. Stop Date Stop date specifies the final date in a date range. A stop date can be assigned all of the same values as a Start date (see previous table), except for the Date label. Representation of dates How dates are displayed to the student depends on the combination of: The design of the current representation for a collection. What dates have been configured. The following animated image demonstrates how the representation of a date changes through the following stages: No date has been configured for the cards representation. A start date is partially and then fully configured. The representation is changed to the assessment table representation and then back to the cards. A stop date is partially and then almost fully configured (the week is not specified, hence no final date). FYI Objects Selecting the FYI switch turns a module into a For Your Information (FYI) object, this means that any representation of the module will: Always appear regardless of whether the visitor has access (e.g. the module is unpublished); Never include any Canvas information about the module (e.g. a link to the module, whether the module is published or unpublished etc.) Only display information about the module configured by Collections (e.g. the banner, the dates, description, label etc.). There are two common uses for an FYI object: \"Coming soon\" modules Allow students to see information about a module that they can't currently access. Helping them understand the complete structure of the course without being able to access the content. Simple information sharing. You have important information to share and want it integrated into the collection's representation, including use of Collection's other features (e.g. banner, dates, etc). But don't need all the additional features of a module (e.g. items) FYI objects and other representations The example below focuses on the GriffithCards representation . All other representations should provide similar support for FYI objects, customised to fit the specifics of the representation. Example The following animated image demonstrates how an FYI object can be used with the following steps: Demonstrate that unpublished modules are not displayed for students. Modify the unpublished module to make it an FYI object. Note how the Engage button disappears after this change. FYI object's can't link to the module. Add some an FYI message. A short textual message is added. This is overlaid on the bottom of the banner. Useful for displaying some additional information for the students. Demonstrate how FYI objects are displayed for students. Even though the associated Canvas module is still unpublished, the FYI object is displayed in student view. Note: The module itself remains invisible to students. All they can see is the FYI object containing information you've configured using Collections. Demonstrate the FYI objects don't need a message Additional Metadata For various reasons you may wish to provide additional metadata about a module. The additional metadata area enables this.

Currently available representations are summarised in the table and the demonstrations below. Separating representation from information A collection's representation can be changed at any time (and then changed back). e.g. the animated examples below used the same course site. The only difference is that the representation for each collection was changed. Each representation offers a different way of showing a collection and its objects. New representations can be added. Name Description CollectionsOnly The bare minimum representation. Modules page modified by adding: 1) the Collections navigation bar; 2) any include pages; and, 3) showing only modules belonging to the current collection. GriffithCards Builds on CollectionsOnly by adding a card component for each module belonging to the current collection. The card component includes a number of additional features to transform the generic Canvas module into a design and context specific object. AssessmentTable Rather than a card, each module is represented by a row in a table. The table is designed to summarises assessment for a course with columns for weighting and learning outcomes. Different Representations Vanilla Canvas The vanilla Canvas Modules page shows a linear list of all the modules in a course (for students all the published modules). The following animated image shows the Modules page for a sample Canvas course containing 13 modules. This same course is used in the demonstrations below. Collections Only The following animated image shows the above course configured with Canvas Collections so that its 13 modules are organised into three collections: Why? , What? , and How? . In this example, each collection is using the Collections Only representation. This is the bare minimum Collections' representation, which modifies the Canvas modules page to include: The collection's navigation bar (hence the name, Collections Only ). This is how you navigate between collections. Any Include Pages configured for the collection. The Why? collection includes some text ( A little bit of an include page -- one one 111 ) after the collection's navigation bar. This is the content of a Canvas page that has been configured as an Include Page for the collection. The modules belonging to the current collection. This is the standard Canvas Modules view, however, when viewing a collection you will only see the modules that belong to the current collection. The above three elements are the bare minimum changes that Collections (when turned on) makes to the Canvas Collections page. The remaining GriffithCards The following animated image shows the same course with the same collections as the previous example. However, this time the GriffithCards representation is being used. This representation generates a card for each object (aka Module) that belongs to the collection. It mirrors the widely used card UI design pattern .

The standard \"live\" version of Canvas Collections requires that you have installed Collections (either individually or institutionally ). Otherwise the Canvas modules view will remain \"vanilla\". Institutional installation is a decision for your entire institution and requires work by your institution's information technology folk. Individual installation requires each person (students and teachers) to install a userscript manager and the Collections userscript. \"Claytons\" Collections is a way to have Collections without having to install it. What? \"Claytons\" Collections is the Collections you have when you're not having Collections (a play on a marketing campaign for a drink ). It's a way of one person install and using Collections to create normal Canvas pages that look like Collections, but can be viewed without Collections. It is a way of semi-automating common advice from the Canvas community to manually create pages to workaround the limitations of Canvas' module view. Some examples of that advice, include: create full navigation using pages , create an inviting course home page , and home sweet home pages without tables . How does it work? There are two steps to using \"Claytons\" Collections: Specify an output page for any collection to be included. You can use \"Claytons\" for one or more collection by specifying the name of an existing Canvas page within your course site. Update the output page for your collection. Any changes you make using Canvas Collections are not automatically reflected in the output page . You will need to manually update the output page to see the changes. There are two different ways to update an output page : (1) update a single page; or, (2) update all pages (Full Claytons). Relationship to existing output page content If a page does not already contain existing content for a collection, the collection's content will be placed at the end of the existing content. If a page already has content for the current collection, it will replace the existing content with the new content. Note When updating an output page Collections does not modify or remove any non-Collection content. Relationship between Collections and output pages A single Canvas page can be an output page for a single collection or multiple collections. A single collection can have an output page identified, or multiple can. How to Specify an output page Each collection's area in the Existing Collections area of the Collections configuration area has an output page text box (see following image). Enter the name of an existing page in the text box. The \"name\" of the page is \"Page Title\" you will see when you edit the page. In the following image the Course Content collection has been configured with an output page with the name Home Page . Update a \"single\" collection In the image above there is an Update button next to the output page name. Clicking this button will update the output page with the current content of that collection. The following animated image demonstrates the process, including these steps: Show the existing Canvas page with some content already in it. Open up the Collections configuration area and find the output page for the Why? collection. Click the update button and observe the alert generated informing of the updates successful completion. Going back to the Canvas page and reloading it to see that the Why? collection's representation has been added to the bottom of the page. Update all Collections (Full Claytons) The \"Full Claytons\" option provides two advantages over the \"single\" update method: Update all collections with output pages at once. Rather than do a single update for each collection, Full Claytons updates all relevant output pages at once. Add navigation options between collections. As well as updating the output pages with the current content of the collections, Full Claytons can also be configured to add a Collections navigation bar to help the user change between collections. There are three navigation options summarised below. The following image demonstrate using the Full Claytons functionality to: Update three collections at one time, all to the one output page . Add the Tabs navigation option to that output page . The process shown, includes: Showing the existing state of the output page (the content generated by the previous animated image). Move to the Modules page and show that all three collections have been configured to use the same output page . Change the Navigation Bar Option to Tabs . Hit the Full Claytons update button. Step through all the alert boxes generated to show progress. Change back to the output page and reload it to see the updated content. Use the Tabs navigation to navigate between the different collections all visible on the same page. The next animated image demonstrates the use of Full Claytons using the other two navigation bar options. Navigation bar options Navigation options are intended to help the user navigate between different Collections. There are three navigation options - summarised in the following table. Navigation Option Description None No navigation interface is added to any of the output pages . Any existing navigation interface is removed Pages Only works when each collection has a different output page . A navigation bar is added to each page, before each collection, to allow the user to navigate between the different collections. Tabs Only works when an output page contains multiple collections. A tabbed navigation interface is added so that only one collection is visible at a time. The interface allows users to switch to a different collection on the same page. The following animated image demonstrates the use of Full Claytons to change between different navigation options, and in doing so demonstrates the Pages and None options. The process shown, includes: Showing an existing output page that used the \"update page\" option (it has not navigation option).

It provides two methods you can use : Update a single page using the output page Update multiple pages using Full Claytons Typically, this is used to place each collection's representation onto its own page. For example, the following animated image that shows the process of placing the representations for three collections ( Why? , What? , and How? ) onto three separate pages (with the same names). The following shows how you can place the representations for these same three collections ( Why? , What? , and How? ) onto a single page. The Process The process for doing this is almost the same as used on the setting up Claytons Collections page . Configure Canvas Collections How many collections for Claytons? \ud83c\udd95 How many pages? Create (or identify) the page(s) required. Set up the page(s) Specify the collection's output page Use Collections to update the pages Once the basics are setup, you can also make it fancy Configure Canvas Collections This only works if Collections is configured for your course. The example here will be using the same course and Collections configuration as the previous example . How many collections for Claytons? As with the previous example the following will use all three available collections. You can choose as many as you like, but since the aim is to include the representations from multiple collections, you'll need at least two. \ud83c\udd95 How many pages? Previously, the example used a single page for each collection. This time, the example will use a single page for all three collections. If you're are using less than one page per per collection, you'll need to perform the \"set up the page(s)\" step below. Create (or identify) the page(s) required. Currently, Collections will not create the pages for you. You'll need to be sure that all the required Canvas pages exist. Set up the page(s) - add each collection's output div Background When Claytons Collections updates a Canvas page it places the HTML for that collections' representation into a HTML tag - a common why to group related HTML. Apart from the HTML, the tag also has an identifier unique to the collection and Claytons Collections. For example, the following image shows the HTML for the How? page from the previous example where the How? page contained the representation for the How? collection. In the image, the tag identifier has been circled in red <div id=\"cc-output-How?\"> . The first part of the identifier is consistent cc-output- for Canvas Collections output. The last part of the identifier is the name of the collection How? . One div per collection If you want to have the representation of more than one collection on a single page OR if you want to specify exactly where the representation is placed on the page, you'll need to add a tag for each collection. For this example, all three collections will be placed on a single page titled All together with the following order: Why? , What? , and How? . The following image shows the HTML for the All together page with the tags and identifiers added. Specify the collection's output page As with the previous example, the output page for each collection needs to be specified. This time, the output page for each collection will be the All together page. As illustrated in the following image. Use Collections to update the pages There are two options that could be used to update the pages summarised in the following tabe. Method Description Features : update the output page Click the update button or each collection Updates the page with just each collection's representation (no navigation bar) Full Claytons Click the Full Claytons and all collections with output pages will be updated Adds both the collection's representation and a navigation bar \u2757\ufe0f Note: If placing multiple collections onto a single page, you probably do NOT want to use Full Claytons . Hence the approach shown in the following animated image uses the update output page option. The image shows that each collection can be updated and its results checked before proceeding. Make it fancy With all this set up, you now have a Canvas page into which you can update the collections' representations. At the moment, the page just has each representation one after the other, you may want to make it a bit fancier than that by, for example Adding a title for each collection. Turning each collection into an accordion. Or some other idea you can translate into HTML. Adding a title for each collection All that's need to achieve this is to edit the All together page and place appropriate headings between each collection's representation.

There are two parts to this step Allocate the modules to a collection; and, Only modules that are allocated to a collection will be displayed. Specify metadata. This additional information about each module is used by representations to modify how the module is displayed. Introducing the module configuration area For teachers and designers, Canvas Collections adds a module specific configuration area to each Module. This is how you configure each module. Find the module configuration area Each module's configuration area will be visible (to teachers and designers) just under the module title - circled in red below. By default the module configuration area is closed. Open the module configuration area As with the Collections configuration area, you open the module configuration area by clicking on the small arrow. This will open the module configuration area and reveal the module's metadata. The following image shows an early version of the module configuration area, currently the major areas of the module configuration area, includes: Collection - used to specify which collection the module belongs to. Label - three elements (label, auto-number, and number) used to specify the module's label and number. Date - specify the date for the module using three elements - day of week; week; and time. Image - associate an image with the module and how it should be scaled to fit with a card. Description - provide a short description or rationale for the module. Additional metadata - add and remove additional metadata in the form of name/value pairs. Use these form elements to set and change the module configuration. Allocate the modules The Collections element will contain a list of the current collections. Use the menu to choose one. When you change the collection allocation for a module, your view of Collections will change in a number of ways. Examine the change Module only appears when its collection is current For example, the Improve Canvas' organisation of course content module was allocated to the Why? collection. It is not visible when viewing the What? collection. Module is represented using the collection's representation The Why? collection was configured to use the GriffithCards representation. Hence the newly allocated module is represented as a card - a rather bare card. Module configuration area lists the allocated collection The allocated module now shows Why? as it's collection. Allocate the remaining modules Once all the modules are allocated to collections, the Collections configuration Existing collections section looks like the following: 3 modules in Why? ; 5 modules in What? ; and, 5 modules in How? . The following animated image shows the rest of the interface once all modules are allocated to collections. Some points to note Some modules remain unpublished . The cards representation adds a warning (visible to teachers and designers) identifying unpublished modules. These will not be visible to students. Navigation between the three collections works as expected. Clicking on the Engage button on a Card brings that module to focus. The cards are all relatively blank with limited metadata (e.g. images, descriptions etc) Time to add some additional metadata. Specify additional metadata As mentioned above, the additional metadata that can be added includes the following list. Each with its own form elements. The following walk-through gives an example of each. Note: As soon as metadata is changed, the module's representation will be updated. | Metadata | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | Description | Some HTML intended to provide students with a description or rationale for the object represented by the module | | Image | A visual image to represent the module | | Label & Number | Explicitly identify a module as a particular object (the label) and its position in the collection (the number - which can be auto calculated) | | Date & Date Label | Specify the day/time when the activity occurs, is due etc. Through a combination of a date and a label (e.g. due, commencing etc) | | Additional metadata | A flexible method for specifying any additional metadata in the form of pairs of name and value | Add a description The description is best used to provide students with additional information about what, why and how they might engage with the activities and information contained by a module. The description is a relative short piece of text entered using a simple visual editor under the description heading of the module configuration area. Entry Representation Add an image The ability to add an image to each module is a powerful way to improve the visual design of ca course and help student way finding by providing a strong, unique a visual representation of the module. Collections uses two pieces of metadata to specify the image and how it is displayed: The Image URL - the web location where the image can be viewed by users of the Canvas course site (e.g. typically the files area of the course site, or on the open web) The Image scale - how the image is scaled to fit within the available space - possibilities are outlined in the following table. Image scale Image scale is implemented and constrained by a standard CSS property called object-fit . The following table outlines the possible values for object-fit that appear in the Image scale drop down in Collections. The animated image below demonstrates how different values affect the display of the image. Value Description cover The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is cropped to fit the available space. contain The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. fill The image is scaled to fill the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is cropped to fit the available space. fit The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. none The image is not scaled. scale-down The image is scaled to fit the available space, maintaining the aspect ratio. The image is not cropped. Image URL The Image URL is a simple text field. The URL can be a web address (e.g. a URL on the open web) or a Canvas file URL. The following animated image demonstrates the process of obtaining a URL for an image within a Canvas course's files area and using it with Collections. Image iframe The Image URL can also be used to contain an iframe/embed code generated by services such as YouTube, Vimeo, Google Maps etc. The following animated image demonstrates the process for and result of adding an iframe. Add a label and a number The label helps identify to the student that a Canvas module is a Lecture , Workshop , Assignment or some other context/learning design specific object. It helps them understand why, what, and how to engage with the module. The number helps establish the order of the objects. A label is simple any sequence of characters (including emojis). There are two options for the number: Auto-number - the number is automatically calculated based on the order of the modules in the collection. The first lecture will be Lecture 1 the second Lecture 2 and so on. This is the default. Explicitly specified string - i.e. you can manually specify any sequence of characters, including emojis, or leave it blank. The Auto-number option is provided to enable modules to be moved around during re-design without having to manually update the number. Auto number example For the current (somewhat contrived) example, it's been decided that the three modules in the Why? collection will be labelled Why 1 , Why 2 and Why 3 . To achieve this, all three modules can be configured using the following approach for label and number . Note that the Auto-number checkbox is checked. With all three Why? collection modules configured this way the representation looks like this. Explicitly specified string examples Both label and number can include any characters you provide - including emojis etc. To explicitly specify a string for the number, you first need to uncheck the Auto-number checkbox. The following image shows the Why 2 module label modified to include an emoji, and the number modified to include a string of characters (including an emoji). With similar changes to the label and number for the other two Why? modules the representation looks (for a short time) like the following image. Add a date and date label Configure a module for the assessment table representation The assessment table representation - as the name suggests - is explicitly designed to represent the collection of assessment information for a course. Consequently, it includes (and perhaps requires) some assessment specific metadata, summarised in the following table. Purpose Source Description Title Name of the Canvas module containing assessment information The title of the assessment item Description The standard Collections description A summary of the assessment item Due Date The standard Collections date The date the assessment item is due or perhaps a date range when the assessment is available Weighting Additional Collection's metadata with the name weighting The % weight of the assessment item Learning outcomes Additional Collection's metadata with the name learning outcomes The learning outcomes that the assessment item is intended to assess The first three are standard metadata already explained above.

To embed more explicitly a design that helps your students understand and navigate your course's modules. For this reason, the true success of Canvas Collections will arise from the quality of your design. Leverage Collections' features In particular, how well your design leverages the features of Canvas Collections , in particular Collections and Objects/Activities . These are the features that help integrate more context and design specific information into your course sites Modules view. Three sample questions This page illustrates how the following questions can guide your design. Actual design will likely be more involved and iterative. The questions are: What collections will you use to group modules? What type of objects/activities does each module represent? What are the relevant metadata for each module? What collections will you use to group modules? The following table summarises the existing modules in the sample course. As is evident from the module names, this course has a very practical focus. Helping people understand and use Canvas Collections. Hence there was some focus on designing the course to answer common practical questions people might have. Practical questions that are typically grouped into three big questions: Why should we both with Canvas Collections? What is Canvas Collections? How do I and my students use Canvas Collections? Which translates very nicely into three collections: Why? What? How? Module Description Collection Improve Canvas' organisation of course content Explain the problem collections solves Why? Provide \"card interface\" functionality in Canvas Explain one of the benefits Why? Platform for generative development Explain a more esoteric benefit Why? What is Canvas Collections? Describe what it is What? What is the student experience? Describe the student experience What? What is the teacher experience? Describe the teacher experience What? What functionality is provided? Overview of collection's functionality What? How does Canvas Collections work? Describe how it works How? How do you install Canvas Collections? Describe how to install it How? How do you configure Canvas Collections (edit the config file)? Describe the most primitive (and deprecated) way to configure it How? How do you configure Canvas Collections? Describe the new way to configure it How? How do you design a Blackboard course migration? How to migrate the Card Interface from Blackboard to Collections How? An example unpublished module Demonstrate how an unpublished module is represented How? What type of objects/activities does each module represent? As a fairly simple course focused more on self-paced information access and not connected to a formal course the modules aren't representative of something formal like a week, lecture, tutorial, theme. However, the intent was to make sure that \"students\" of the course could clearly navigate to where they needed to go and have a bit of fun along the way. What are the relevant metadata for each module? The following table summarises the metadata currently supported by Canvas Collections and a description of current common uses.

It illustrates how a different representation reuses some metadata (description and date) and ignores other metadata (image, engage). It also shows how additional metadata (e.g. learning outcomes and weighting can be used in one representation (assessment table) but ignored in another (Griffith Cards).

It is a way to use Collections' features without students and others having access to Collections. Setting up Claytons Collections involves the following steps: Configure Canvas Collections for your course site. Decide how many Collections you'll configure with Claytons. Create a Canvas page for each Collection. Specify the collection's output page. Use Collections to update the pages. The last step is one you repeat every time you make a change to Collections. Configure Canvas Collections The Configure Collections walk through steps through this process. This example will use the Canvas course configured in that walk through an pictured below. It has three collections: Why? , What? , and How? . How many collections for Claytons? Claytons Collections is simply a method of copying the representation of a single Collection (e.g. Why? ) to a matching Canvas page. Hence, an early decisions is how many and which of your course's collections you wish to use with Claytons. In this example, all three will be used. Create (or identify) a Canvas page for each Collection Since Claytons copies a representation of a collection to a Canvas page, each collection needs a matching Canvas page. Use the standard process for creating a Canvas page . Use any name you like for each page, common advice would include: Using the same name as the collection will reinforce the information architecture and possibly minimise confusion. If you wish students to see the page, it will need to be published. Using existing pages is fine. Collections will not overwrite any existing content on the page. By default it will add the collections' representation to the bottom of the page. The following image shows that this advice as been followed. There are three new pages, each matching the three collections in the example. Each page has been published. Specify the collection's output page This step links a collection to the page that was just created, enabling it be updated. It is done using the Collections configuration dialog and requires that you enter the name of the appropriate page as the Output Page . for a collection. The following image shows progress in specifying the output pages for the example course. The Output page sections have been circled in red. The Why? collection has had its output page specified and there is a matching Update button. The What? collection has had its output page entered, but not yet finished. This is why there is no Update button. Use Collections to update the pages There are two methods for updating the pages: Update the output page for a single collection; or, Full \"Claytons\". Update the output page Used to update a single collection's output page. Will not include the collection's navigation bar. Is done by clicking the Update button next to a collection's Output page . Full \"Claytons\" The \"Full Claytons\" differs from \"update\" in two ways: All output pages are updated. Each output page will contain the collection's representation AND a navigation bar that enables navigation between the pages. \"Full Claytons\" has its own Update button in the Collections configuration dialog. Click this and Collections will update each page in turn. The following image looks at each individual page before applying \"Full Claytons\". Showing the pages don't have any content. It then shows the process of applying \"Full Claytons\". Then it revisits one of the pages and reloads the page to see the updated content.
